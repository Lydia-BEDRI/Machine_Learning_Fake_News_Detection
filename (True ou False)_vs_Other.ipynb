The main antagonists were subjected to bricks thrown at them from atop a building, being shot with a staple gun, having their heads lit afire, and being electrocuted. It is actually hard to watch.  But, for CBC TV in Canada, the following scene was too much, and had to be removed from their broadcast of the film:  That\\u2019s right, ComicBook.com reports that CBC edited out Donald Trump\\u2019s cameo from the 1992 movie. And people watching it were quick to report the suspicious omission on social media. Some were outraged, and the snowflakes were thrilled.  You guys are the biggest bush league \\u201cjournalists\\u201d of all time. Editing out Trump\\u2019s cameo in Home Alone 2. What kind of state-sponsored bullshit it that? #Defund \\u2014 James @Jameseast_ December 23, 2019  https://twitter.com/TEKO8827/status/1209962103295086592  @CBC Cutting Trump from Home Alone 2 is disgusting & your pathetic \\u2014 Wrestling Fan Forever @617WrestlingFan December 25, 2019  https://twitter.com/ADiMarco25/status/1206364668576579586  According to the CBC, the movie \\u201cwas edited to allow for commercial time within the format.\\u201d  Here\\u2019s where that explanation fails to pass the smell test:  Donald Trump formally announced his campaign in June 2015. The first time the CBC\\u2019s cutting of Trump\\u2019s cameo appearance was acknowledged on Twitter was around Christmas that year:  Thanks @CBC for cutting @realDonaldTrump out of Home Alone 2. \\u2014 Colt McCaullany???? @DENNISGRIMBLE December 22, 2015  Now, either 2015 happened to be the first year the CBC broadcasted the movie, which I highly doubt, or something happened between the 2014 CBC broadcast of Home Alone 2, and the 2015 CBC broadcast. One could argue that Trump wasn\\u2019t a political figure in the public\\u2019s conscious before 2015, but years prior he had been making headlines for publicly questioning Obama\\u2019s birth certificate\\u2014so I don\\u2019t think that excuse really works. Had his cameo been cut before then, I\\u2019m sure it would have been noticed.  Trump\\u2019s presidential bid appears to be the beginning of the folks at the CBC being triggered by Trump so badly that they actually had to edit him out of their broadcast of the film. I can\\u2019t decide if this is hilarious or sad.  Update January 2: Just to be clear, the CBC issued a formal statement saying Home Alone 2 was edited in 2014 when they first obtained the rights to the movie.  _____  Matt Margolis is the author of Trumping Obama: How President Trump Saved Us From Barack Obama\\u2019s Legacy and the bestselling book The Worst President in History: The Legacy of Barack Obama.

told missourinet that marshall wasn\\u2019t exactly correct about federal oversight of automatic weapons, citing 2011 legislation passed by state lawmakers known as house bill 294.  \\u201cpart of this omnibus gun bill that year legalizing machine guns in the state of missouri. we legalized them here. and ever since then, continually my whole time in the legislature, we have loosened restriction.\\u201d  newman also said voters have failed to hold lawmakers responsible for current laws which allow access to rapid fire weapons. \\u201cwe elect people and then expect them to change their spots when they are in office. they\\u2019re not going to do it because they\\u2019re answering to the gun lobby. the gun lobby only cares about more sales. that\\u2019s it\\u201d.  austin petersen, a republican candidate for the u.s. senate seat held by mccaskill, expressed sadness over the shooting and asked for unity in overcoming it.  \\u201ci\\u2019m heartbroken over the tragic event in las vegas yesterday,\\u201d petersen said. \\u201cthis horrendous act of violence touches and hurts us all as a nation and we must come together to heal and find answers. i send my most sincere condolences to all of the victims and their families. please help and love one another.\\u201d  petersen has criticized facebook for banning him from the site for 30 days after he posted a live stream video of himself talking about an ar-15 rifle he\\u2019s giving away. an ar-15 is a semi-automatic weapon.  during an interview with missourinet columbia affiliate kssz, petersen said ban was politically motivated. \\u201cfacebook\\u2019s chief operating officer sheryl sandberg has donated the maximum amount allowable to my opponent claire mccaskill, so something\\u2019s fishy.\\u201d

epstein isle it\\u2019s no secret that epstein and schiff share a long history of perversion. last year, it was revealed by the fbi that the two corresponded by email on several occasions, totaling 256 emails. but, according to the latest leak, it goes much deeper than just emails.  the reasons for the visits were not recorded, but based on the emails between the two men, we can assume they were for nefarious reasons.  an fbi insider has leaked the extensive visitor logs to epstein isle. several notable names were mentioned in the log, including bill clinton, bill gates, jeff bezos, and nancy pelosi. but the most frequent visitor was none other than adam schiff, who visited 78 times over the span of five years.  chief inspector of the department of investigation, joe barron, gave his thoughts about the case, saying the details were sickening.  \\u201cwhat we have discovered over the past few months has been disturbing, to say the least. this goes to very very highest levels. no one could have predicted this. only the foil hats would have thought this to be possible. schiff looks to be the ringleader of the operation, arranging the trades and handled the financing. i can\\u2019t say anything else since it\\u2019s a nonexistent investigation, but rest assured justice will be served. in america, no one is above the law, except the rich.\\u201d  this is truly sickening news, but not unexpected. it was well-known that schiff and epstein were in cahoots, but the fact that epstein was one of the main figures behind the operation was unexpected. this explains the impeachment hoax, since he was looking for a distraction.  these people are in the highest levels of government and need to be found out and prosecuted.  we can\\u2019t have this type of behavior
