The authorization was based on the FDA\\u2019s thorough and transparent evaluation of the data that included input from independent advisory committee experts who overwhelmingly voted in favor of making the vaccine available to children in this age group.  Key points for parents and caregivers:  Effectiveness: Immune responses of children 5 through 11 years of age were comparable to those of individuals 16 through 25 years of age. In addition, the vaccine was found to be 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19 in children 5 through 11.  Safety: The vaccine\\u2019s safety was studied in approximately 3,100 children age 5 through 11 who received the vaccine and no serious side effects have been detected in the ongoing study.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\u2019s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will meet next week to discuss further clinical recommendations.  \\u201cAs a mother and a physician, I know that parents, caregivers, school staff, and children have been waiting for today\\u2019s authorization. Vaccinating younger children against COVID-19 will bring us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy,\\u201d said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. \\u201cOur comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the data pertaining to the vaccine\\u2019s safety and effectiveness should help assure parents and guardians that this vaccine meets our high standards.\\u201d  The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children 5 through 11 years of age is administered as a two-dose primary series, 3 weeks apart, but is a lower dose (10 micrograms) than that used for individuals 12 years of age and older (30 micrograms).  In the U.S., COVID-19 cases in children 5 through 11 years of age make up 39% of cases in individuals younger than 18 years of age. According to the CDC, approximately 8,300 COVID-19 cases in children 5 through 11 years of age resulted in hospitalization. As of Oct. 17, 691 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported in the U.S. in individuals less than 18 years of age, with 146 deaths in the 5 through 11 years age group.  \\u201cThe FDA is committed to making decisions that are guided by science that the public and healthcare community can trust. We are confident in the safety, effectiveness and manufacturing data behind this authorization. As part of our commitment to transparency around our decision-making, which included our public advisory committee meeting earlier this week, we have posted documents today supporting our decision and additional information detailing our evaluation of the data will be posted soon. We hope this information helps build confidence of parents who are deciding whether to have their children vaccinated,\\u201d said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA\\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.  The FDA has determined this Pfizer vaccine has met the criteria for emergency use authorization. Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, the known and potential benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in individuals down to 5 years of age outweigh the known and potential risks.  FDA Evaluation of Available Effectiveness Data  The effectiveness data to support the EUA in children down to 5 years of age is based on an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled study that has enrolled approximately 4,700 children 5 through 11 years of age. The study is being conducted in the U.S., Finland, Poland and Spain. Children in the vaccine group received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine containing 10 micrograms of messenger RNA per dose. The FDA analyzed data that compared the immune response of 264 participants from this study to 253 participants 16 through 25 years of age who had two higher doses of the vaccine in a previous study which determined the vaccine to be effective in preventing COVID-19. The immune responses of the younger age participants were comparable to the older participants.  The FDA also conducted a preliminary analysis of cases of COVID-19 occurring seven days after the second dose. In this analysis, among participants without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, 3 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 1,305 vaccine recipients and 16 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 663 placebo recipients; the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19.  FDA Evaluation of Available Safety Data  The available safety data to support the EUA include more than 4,600 participants (3,100 vaccine, 1,538 placebo) ages 5 through 11 years enrolled in the ongoing study. In this trial, a total of 1,444 vaccine recipients were followed for safety for at least 2 months after the second dose.  Commonly reported side effects in the clinical trial included injection site pain (sore arm), redness and swelling, fatigue, headache, muscle and/or joint pain, chills, fever, swollen lymph nodes, nausea and decreased appetite. More children reported side effects after the second dose than after the first dose. Side effects were generally mild to moderate in severity and occurred within two days after vaccination, and most went away within one to two days.  The FDA and CDC safety surveillance systems have previously identified increased risks of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of tissue surrounding the heart) following vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, particularly following the second dose, and with the observed risk highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Therefore, the FDA conducted its own benefit-risk assessment using modelling to predict how many symptomatic COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths from COVID-19 the vaccine in children 5 through 11 years of age would prevent versus the number of potential myocarditis cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths that the vaccine might cause. The FDA\\u2019s model predicts that overall, the benefits of the vaccine would outweigh its risks in children 5 through 11 years of age.  Ongoing Safety Monitoring  Pfizer Inc. has updated its safety monitoring plan to include evaluation of myocarditis, pericarditis and other events of interest in children 5 through 11 years of age. In addition, the FDA and the CDC have several systems in place to continually monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety and allow for the rapid detection and investigation of potential safety problems.  It is mandatory for Pfizer Inc. and vaccination providers to report to any serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death in vaccinated individuals. It is also mandatory for vaccination providers to report all vaccine administration errors to VAERS for which they become aware and for Pfizer Inc. to include a summary and analysis of all identified vaccine administration errors in monthly safety reports to the FDA.  Data Supports New Vaccine Formulation to Improve Stability and Storage Conditions  The FDA today also authorized a manufacturing change for the vaccine to include a formulation that uses a different buffer; buffers help maintain a vaccine\\u2019s pH (a measure of how acidic or alkaline a solution is) and stability. This new formulation is more stable at refrigerated temperatures for longer periods of time, permitting greater flexibility for vaccination providers.  The new formulation of the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. contains Tris buffer, a commonly used buffer in a variety of other FDA-approved vaccines and other biologics, including products for use in children. The FDA evaluated manufacturing data to support the use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine containing Tris buffer and concluded it does not present safety or effectiveness concerns.

House Bill 7 is sponsored by Speaker of the House Brian Egolf (D-Santa Fe),  Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena (D-Mesilla), Rep. Joanne Ferrary (D-Las Cruces), Rep. Deborah Armstrong (D-Albuquerque) and Rep. Georgene Louis (D-Albuquerque).  \\u201cHouse Bill 7 simply repeals the outdated and dangerous abortion ban of 1969 that was designed to keep New Mexicans from accessing the health care they may need,\\u201d Rep. Cadena said. \\u201cPregnant people and their families deserve continued access to safe and legal abortion. By repealing this dangerous statute, we are making sure this ban is never enforceable in New Mexico again.\\u201d  \\u201cAbortion is health care, and all New Mexicans have a right to health care without politics interfering and without fear or penalty,\\u201d Rep. Ferrary said. \\u201cMedical decisions, especially those regarding reproductive care, are deeply personal and complex and should be made between a woman, her family and her doctor, to be guided by her own faith and values.\\u201d  \\u201cThe majority of New Mexicans believe that a woman\\u2019s right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion, should be protected. New Mexicans support abortion access and trust each other to make their own decisions,\\u201d Speaker Egolf said. \\u201cWith HB 7, we\\u2019re making sure that no matter what happens in Washington, DC, New Mexicans will always be able to make their own health care decisions.\\u201d  The 1969 New Mexico abortion ban became unenforceable following the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision; however, it is still in New Mexico state statute. HB 7 is a repeal of the 1969 ban, ensuring that these dangerous restrictions on reproductive health care will not be enforced in New Mexico should Roe v. Wade be overturned by a future Supreme Court.  House Bill 7 passed committee with a bipartisan 8-3 vote, and will now be heard in the House Judiciary Committee.  Members of the public can track legislation on the New Mexico Legislature website and access committee meetings and House floor sessions on the Webcasts tab.

Nationally, feral swine cause major damage to property, agriculture crops and livestock, native species and ecosystems, and cultural and historic resources. This invasive species costs the United States an estimated $1.5 billion each year in damages and control costs.  Related: No end in sight for Texas' war against feral swine  In addition to these concerns, because of their very nature, feral swine, which wallow along river banks, lakes and ponds, are known to spread diseases to other types of wildlife, and domestic animals. Feral pigs are also becoming a problem in some suburban areas as they root up turf at homes, parks and golf courses. They also turn over and root through trash cans in suburban areas and pose a driving hazard when moving in large numbers near roadways and highways.  In recent years a major effort to control population numbers has helped, but wildlife and public health officials say more needs to be done. But with an estimated five million feral swine running free in the United States, controlling the problem appears to be greater than current efforts to manage their numbers.  Limited Control Options  Existing control methods include hunting and trapping the animals, but in spite of eliminating a considerable number of the animals, feral swine continue to spread into other states not previously known to be feeding or breeding grounds. Overall, 39 states have reported some level of problem with wild pigs.  Texas is home to more feral pigs than any other state \\u2014 an estimated 30 percent to 50 percent of all feral swine in the nation, according to USDA. More effort to reduce their numbers has occurred in Texas than anywhere else, representing more traps, more hunts, and more research. Yet their numbers are growing, and so is the amount of damage they cause each year.  In 2017 Texas Commissioner of Agriculture Sid Miller unveiled a wide-reaching plan to deal with the feral hog problem, calling for what he termed a hog-apocalypse involving the distribution of a deadly poison bait. Miller initially approved the legal use of a commercial poison that contained warfarin, the same drug used to kill rats or prescribed by doctors, in smaller doses, to prevent blood clots. Once feral swine ingest the poison, they begin to bleed internally. But hunters and conservationists expressed concern, fearing other animals may be exposed to the toxin, possibly affecting any animal or human predator feeding on the meat of a poisoned pig.  Shortly after announcing its use, the manufacturer of the poison bait voluntarily removed the product from the market out of fear of lawsuits and other possible retribution.  Toxic Bait Evaluation  Now, USDA\\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service APHIS is evaluating another type of oral toxic bait for use with invasive feral swine. APHIS received an Experimental Use Permit EUP from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to conduct sodium nitrite toxic bait field trials on free-roaming feral swine in Texas and Alabama last November, and signed a final environmental assessment and issued a Decision and Finding of No Significant Impact FONSI associated with conducting field trials using the poison.  Wildlife Services takes the selection and use of toxic baits for use in wildlife damage management very seriously. The final environmental assessments, FONSI and EUP, are the result of years of collaborative research by Wildlife Services and multiple private, state, federal and international partners, reports APHIS Wildlife Services WS Deputy Administrator Bill Clay. With these in place, we can now begin field trials to help determine the effectiveness of the sodium nitrite toxic bait for removing feral swine sounders in natural settings, as well as any potential impacts to non-target wildlife.  Safeguards  Clay says the EUP allows researchers to partner with landowners to identify and target three to nine feral swine sounders herds each in Texas and Alabama. He said bait delivery systems designed to prevent access by non-target wildlife will be filled with placebo bait, placed in the sounders\\u2019 territories and monitored with motion-activated cameras.  Following a period of acclimation to confirm feral swine use of the baiting areas, the placebo bait will be replaced with sodium nitrite toxic bait for two nights. As a research method, at least 30 feral swine and no more than 30 raccoons in each state\\u2019s study area are to be captured live and radio-collared prior to baiting in order to monitor their movements and exposure to the bait. Landowners within 300 meters of bait stations will be notified, and signs will be placed on bait stations and along roads leading into the study areas.  Sodium nitrite NaNO2 is a meat preservative commonly used to cure meats such as sausage and bacon. When eaten in high doses over a short period of time, it is toxic to feral swine. The mode of death is similar to carbon monoxide poisoning. Once enough sodium nitrite bait is eaten, the feral swine gets faint, is rendered unconscious, and quickly dies. In most cases, feral swine die within two and-a-half to three hours after eating a lethal dose, Clay said.  Researchers say many factors are considered when developing a toxic bait for feral swine. Not only must it be effective and humane in eliminating feral swine, but also must be low risk for those handling it, the environment, and wildlife. Other wildlife, such as raccoons, bears and deer, may be attracted to the sodium nitrite toxic bait, but to prevent non-target species from accessing it, researchers will use delivery systems and baiting strategies designed to target feral swine. Trials will not be conducted in areas with known black bear populations.  The trials are scheduled to begin in both Alabama and Texas as early as February.  Although trapping, aerial operations, and recreational hunting of feral swine have effectively reduced damage in some areas, studies show that at least 70 percent of feral swine must be removed each year in order to prevent population growth, Clay said. Should the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approve the toxic bait for use with feral swine, it could become another tool in the toolbox for integrated feral swine damage management.  Skeptics  While farmers welcome technology that helps to control the damaging swine in their fields, there are skeptics.  Roland Ortiz, a commercial trapper and hunter in the San Antonio area, says wild hogs are very intelligent creatures, and they are prolific breeders. Ortiz stays busy hunting and trapping hogs on farms, ranches and lately in subdivisions that contract his services.  We are slowly pushing back into more sparsely populated areas, but they keep coming back. Managing them is a full time job, Ortiz said.  While he agrees a toxic bait would help to control wild swine populations, he doubts anything will ever solve the problem.  We have rat poison, but there's still lots of rats, Ortiz notes.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

communist party **membership** list nation  u.s. state governors names on china communist party **membership** list  a database obtained by computer hackers from china communist party computers allegedly reveals the names of more than a dozen u.s. state governors who are reportedly shown in the database as being members of china's communist party:  the database was originally leaked on telegram, the encrypted instant messaging app, and passed in september by a chinese dissident to the inter-parliamentary alliance on china, which comprises more than 150 legislators around the world who are concerned by the influence and activities of the chinese government. here is a statement from ipac about the data:  detailed analysis by u.s. intelligence sources say the list is genuine!  the list mostly includes the details of ccp members based in shanghai, in more than 79,000 branches, or cells. the ccp's total membership currently stands at more than 92 million, with a success rate of around 10 percent for aspiring members.  china communist party (ccp) members have infiltrated not only some of the largest corporations of the us, australia and the uk, but also many consulates and government agencies, giving them access to sensitive and no doubt compromising information that would give the ccp an edge on the world stage.  make no mistake, these agents ultimately answer directly to the party and chairman xi jinping.  this is a fascinating look inside the ccp\\u2019s infiltration network and gives us an idea of just how deeply their agents have been embedded.  the original database in chinese contains some 1.95 million names, the majority from shanghai, many complete with national id number & personal details, but also contains the details of some 79,000 communist party branches, many of them inside the companies they have infiltrated. some of the names are listed as having been \\u201cexecuted\\u201d while others have notes regarding organs and a price.  take a quick look at how the ccp works:  georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger who ran what may be the most fraudulent election in the nation on november 3, where president trump lost the traditionally red state, has a brother. meet brother, ron raffensperger cto for huawei enterprise storage solutions, the data storage company of . . . . the ccp.  the same chinese communist party (ccp) that paid dominion $400 million through a subsidiary of hsbc, a month or so before the november 3 election, which may have gotten the ccp the ability to \\\"update\\\" dominion voting software for the then-upcoming u.s. presidential election!  elsewhere, other key people are tunring out to have strong connections to the ccp. michigan secretary of state jocelyn benson \\u2013 currently obstructing efforts to investigate michigan\\u2019s election results \\u2013 developed ties with chinese state-run universities and trained lawyers for the chinese communist party \\u2013 even delivering a lecture at chinese premier xi jinping\\u2019s alma mater.    benson undertook the work aiding the chinese communist party while serving as the dean of wayne law school in detroit, michigan.  being the cto for a mega corporation like huawei pays huge bucks. maybe some of that money is going to a certain secretary of state? who knows what's happening between the two brothers . . . maybe at the behest of the ccp?  china's infiltration efforts have been vast. major aerospace companies airbus, rolls-royce, and boeing have employed hundreds of ccp members. additionally, pfizer and british drugmaker astrazeneca (covid-19 vaccine developer!) employed a total of 123 party members. british automaker jaguar land rover also employed ccp members.  now, back to the usa. the governors allegedly named in the database are listed below:    az - ducey    ar - hutchinson    ca - newsome    ct - lamont    nm - grisham    vt - scott    ia - reynolds    ri - raimondo    ne - ricketts    de - carney    in - holcomb    nv - sisolak    tn - lee    ky - beshear    id - little    mt - bullock    or - brown    il - pritzker    la - edwards    tx - abbott    mn - waltz    ma- baker  nc-cooper    ut - herbert  other names totaling 1.9 million people, are also on the list, which is still being sorted and translated. the process of translating is taking longer than expected, but it looks like this: (click image to enlarge)  pompeo warned them all  earlier this year, u.s. secretary of state, mike pompeo, spoke at the national governor's association winter meeting and he warned governors they were being targeted by china. he told the governors that china was doing harm to the us and to our industries, and they were moving to manipulate governors into doing things that would help china at the expense of america. pompeo warned them all to be careful.  the warning apparently came too late because based on the information outlined above, obtained from computer hackers, it seems that several u.s. state governors may have already sold-out and become communists.  communism illegal in the united states  the communist party is unlawful in the united states. it's very existence is banned by federal law. here is the law:  of course, while the federal law above bans the communist party of the united states, it does not ban the communist party of china. the question then becomes, have these governors become members of the china communist party (ccp) for the same purpose as that previously espoused by the communist party of the united states? same political ideology . . . same goal?  folks who live in states whose governor's name appears on the ccp member list, need to make a major fuss about this and find out what's what.  if your governor is a communist, then your governor has to go.  now.  no exceptions.  now that you have read this story, please cover the cost for what your visit cost this site by clicking one or more of the ads below

for information and broadcasting farrukh habib on tuesday described the pakistan muslim league-nawaz\\u2019s (pml-n) criticism on the pakistan media development authority (pmda) as \\u2018unfounded\\u2019.  \\u201cconsultative process on the pmda\\u2019s framework is underway. the pml-n\\u2019s criticism on it is beyond comprehension,\\u201d he said in a news release while reacting to pml-n spokesperson marriyum aurangzeb\\u2019s statement.  \\u201cthere will be no restriction on media freedom [with establishment of pmda,\\u201d farrukh said while lashing out at those who were trying to mislead the people with interpretation of pmda according to their own whims.  he criticized the opposition for resorting to political point-scoring on the pmda without reading draft of its framework.  farrukh chided marriyum for criticizing the pmda and said she did not even bother to attend joint meeting of the standing committee on information and broadcasting.  he said all the media forums including all pakistan newspapers society (apns), council of pakistan newspaper editors (cpne), pakistan broadcasters association (pba), press clubs and other stakeholders had been made part of the consultative process.  all the stakeholders assured full support on the steps that would ensure journalists and media workers\\u2019 job security and in-time salaries and regulation of digital media, he added.  he said in the past, it was tradition of enacting laws overnight, adding it was the present government which had set a precedent of holding consultation with stakeholders before drafting laws.  farrukh said everybody including media knew as to how the pml-n dealt with media during their tenure of government in the country.  the minister said the pmda framework was being developed in the same manner that the developed countries had adopted to deal with the challenges stemming from the evolutionary process of media.  he said the pmda would not only regulate digital media and develop the industry in an effective manner, but also ensure freedom of expression and protection of journalists\\u2019 rights. it would also ensure job security and in-time issuance of salaries of journalists and media workers, he added.  the pmda was meant for bringing all the concerned agencies under one umbrella to facilitate the journalists and workers of all forms of the media in an efficient manner, farrukh noted.  he said previously, there was no platform for resolution of electronic media\\u2019s journalists and workers\\u2019 problems.  the minister said the pmda was being set up to make media-related institutions more efficient and effective. the present government firmly believed in freedom of the media and expression as enshrined in article 19 of the constitution.  in the past, he said there were instances when the pakistan tehreek-e-insaf fully participated in the movements launched for independence of the judiciary and media in the country.\",\n          \"kremlin: putin\\u2019s 'heaven' remark symbolism, russia rejects notion of preemptive strike milwaukee emerged as america's fourth-most impoverished big city in 2009, as the great recession rippled across the city and state, according to u.s. census bureau figures released tuesday. milwaukee's poverty rate reached 27%, up from 23.4% in the previous year. only detroit (36.4%), cleveland (35%) and buffalo (28.8%) had higher poverty rates among cities with populations greater than 250,000. milwaukee was ranked 11th in 2008. an estimated 158,245 milwaukeeans lived in poverty last year. for a family of four with two adults and two children, the poverty threshold was an annual income of $21,954. what's more, nearly 4 in 10 children in milwaukee were considered poor, meaning an estimated 62,432 children lived in poverty last year, up from 49,952 in 2008. milwaukee mayor tom barrett, a democrat who is running for governor, said the poverty numbers \\\"are unacceptable and should be of concern to everyone in the community and the state.\\\" \\\"they obviously are in part a result of the global economic downturn which has disproportionately affected lower incomes,\\\" he said. \\\"but it has also sent lower middle-class people into poverty as well. it explains why we're looking so aggressive to create more jobs, tackle the issues of education, workforce development and transportation.\\\" milwaukee county executive scott walker, the republican candidate for governor, said the \\\"anti-business\\\" policies of democrats barrett and sitting governor jim doyle have directly affected \\\"the poverty levels in milwaukee and cities across our state.\\\" \\\"as governor, i'll work to get government out of the way so we can help struggling families and bring 250,000 jobs to wisconsin,\\\" walker said in a statement. barrett disputed walker's assertion and said, \\\"i have never seen any signs that he is interested in addressing the poverty issues in our community, period.\\\" he said that jobs provide the best remedy for alleviating poverty and added that he would prefer the issue not be politicized. \\\"i wish this is one (issue) we could reach across the aisle and work together,\\\" barrett said. michael bonds, president of the milwaukee school board, said he was not surprised by the newest poverty figures. \\\"i think we're at a critical point when we're starting to see some of the broader things in the community impacting students,\\\" he said. \\\"not only do schools have to deal with traditional education, but now they also have to provide supports that were traditionally provided by other agencies, because those institutions are also facing financial challenges,\\\" he added. bonds said he doesn't see any quick-fix to bring children out of poverty in milwaukee. \\\"some areas of the city, you see african-american unemployment reaching 60% to 70%,\\\" he said. marc levine, executive director of the center for economic development at the university of wisconsin-milwaukee, said the latest census data reflect the city's lack of job growth. \\\"our analysis of employment data shows that milwaukee has had among the worst job creation records of any big city in the u.s. for over a decade, so it is not surprising that poverty numbers have worsened, especially during the worst recession since the great depression,\\\" levine said. hard times didn't hit just in milwaukee. real median household income in the state declined between 2008 and 2009 - decreasing by 3.8% from $51,942 to $49,993. poverty also surged statewide from 10.4% to 12.4% in 2009. there were an estimated 570,583 people in poverty in the state in 2008 and 683,408 people in poverty in 2009. nationally, poverty increased from 38.3 million people in 2008 to 42.8 million in 2009. ken taylor, executive director of the wisconsin council on children and families, labeled the poverty numbers as \\\"brutal\\\" and said they \\\"confirm our worst fears about the reality of the recession on kids.\\\" \\\"the idea that what happens in milwaukee doesn't influence ozaukee county is a fallacy,\\\" he said. \\\"we're all affected across the state by the challenges in milwaukee.\\\" in the suburbs outside milwaukee, the poverty rates were much lower, led by waukesha county (4.8%) while ozaukee (5.3%) and washington (5.4%) counties were not much higher. the poverty rates in those counties all increased at least 1 percentage point. the results come from the american community survey, which provides a snapshot of the nation's socioeconomic, housing and demographic characteristics. later this year, the census bureau will release the first results from the 2010 census, the complete count of every person in the country. erin richards of the journal sentinel staff contributed to this report.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

Limited Control Options exist control method include hunt and trap the animal , but in spite of eliminate a considerable number of the animal , feral swine continue to spread into other state not previously know to be feed or breeding ground . overall , 39 state have report some level of problem with wild pig . Texas be home to more feral pig than any other state \\u2014 an estimate 30 percent to 50 percent of all feral swine in the nation , accord to USDA . More effort to reduce their number have occur in Texas than anywhere else , represent more trap , more hunt , and more research . yet their number be grow , and so be the amount of damage they cause each year . in 2017 Texas Commissioner of Agriculture Sid Miller unveil a wide - reach plan to deal with the feral hog problem , call for what he term a hog - apocalypse involve the distribution of a deadly poison bait . Miller initially approve the legal use of a commercial poison that contain warfarin , the same drug use to kill rat or prescribe by doctor , in small dose , to prevent blood clot . once feral swine ingest the poison , they begin to bleed internally . but hunter and conservationist express concern , fear other animal may be expose to the toxin , possibly affect any animal or human predator feed on the meat of a poison pig . shortly after announce it use , the manufacturer of the poison bait voluntarily remove the product from the market out of fear of lawsuit and other possible retribution . Toxic Bait Evaluation now , USDA \\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service APHIS be evaluate another type of oral toxic bait for use with invasive feral swine . aphis receive an Experimental Use Permit eup from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to conduct sodium nitrite toxic bait field trial on free - roaming feral swine in Texas and Alabama last November , and sign a final environmental assessment and issue a decision and finding of no Significant Impact FONSI associate with conduct field trial use the poison . Wildlife Services take the selection and use of toxic bait for use in wildlife damage management very seriously . the final environmental assessment , FONSI and EUP , be the result of year of collaborative research by Wildlife Services and multiple private , state , federal and international partner , report APHIS Wildlife Services WS Deputy Administrator Bill Clay . with these in place , we can now begin field trial to help determine the effectiveness of the sodium nitrite toxic bait for remove feral swine sounder in natural setting , a well a any potential impact to non - target wildlife . Safeguards Clay say the eup allow researcher to partner with landowner to identify and target three to nine feral swine sounder herd each in Texas and Alabama . he say bait delivery system design to prevent access by non - target wildlife will be fill with placebo bait , place in the sounder \\u2019 territory and monitor with motion - activate camera . follow a period of acclimation to confirm feral swine use of the baiting area , the placebo bait will be replace with sodium nitrite toxic bait for two night . a a research method , at least 30 feral swine and no more than 30 raccoon in each state \\u2019s study area be to be capture live and radio - collar prior to bait in order to monitor their movement and exposure to the bait . landowner within 300 meter of bait station will be notify , and sign will be place on bait station and along road lead into the study area . Sodium nitrite NaNO2 be a meat preservative commonly use to cure meat such a sausage and bacon . when eat in high dose over a short period of time , it be toxic to feral swine . the mode of death be similar to carbon monoxide poisoning . once enough sodium nitrite bait be eat , the feral swine get faint , be render unconscious , and quickly die . in most case , feral swine die within two and - a - half to three hour after eat a lethal dose , Clay say . researcher say many factor be consider when develop a toxic bait for feral swine . not only must it be effective and humane in eliminate feral swine , but also must be low risk for those handle it , the environment , and wildlife . other wildlife , such a raccoon , bear and deer , may be attract to the sodium nitrite toxic bait , but to prevent non - target specie from access it , researcher will use delivery system and bait strategy design to target feral swine . trial will not be conduct in area with know black bear population . the trial be schedule to begin in both Alabama and Texas a early a February . although trapping , aerial operation , and recreational hunting of feral swine have effectively reduce damage in some area , study show that at least 70 percent of feral swine must be remove each year in order to prevent population growth , Clay say . should the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approve the toxic bait for use with feral swine , it could become another tool in the toolbox for integrate feral swine damage management . skeptic while farmer welcome technology that help to control the damage swine in their field , there be skeptic . Roland Ortiz , a commercial trapper and hunter in the San Antonio area , say wild hog be very intelligent creature , and they be prolific breeder . Ortiz stay busy hunt and trap hog on farm , ranch and lately in subdivision that contract his service . we be slowly push back into more sparsely populated area , but they keep come back . manage they be a full time job , Ortiz say . while he agree a toxic bait would help to control wild swine population , he doubt anything will ever solve the problem . we have rat poison , but there be still lot of rat , Ortiz note .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"combined_with_all\",\n      \"properties\": {\n

The main antagonists were subjected to bricks thrown at them from atop a building, being shot with a staple gun, having their heads lit afire, and being electrocuted. It is actually hard to watch.  But, for CBC TV in Canada, the following scene was too much, and had to be removed from their broadcast of the film:  That\\u2019s right, ComicBook.com reports that CBC edited out Donald Trump\\u2019s cameo from the 1992 movie. And people watching it were quick to report the suspicious omission on social media. Some were outraged, and the snowflakes were thrilled.  You guys are the biggest bush league \\u201cjournalists\\u201d of all time. Editing out Trump\\u2019s cameo in Home Alone 2. What kind of state-sponsored bullshit it that? #Defund \\u2014 James @Jameseast_ December 23, 2019  https://twitter.com/TEKO8827/status/1209962103295086592  @CBC Cutting Trump from Home Alone 2 is disgusting & your pathetic \\u2014 Wrestling Fan Forever @617WrestlingFan December 25, 2019  https://twitter.com/ADiMarco25/status/1206364668576579586  According to the CBC, the movie \\u201cwas edited to allow for commercial time within the format.\\u201d  Here\\u2019s where that explanation fails to pass the smell test:  Donald Trump formally announced his campaign in June 2015. The first time the CBC\\u2019s cutting of Trump\\u2019s cameo appearance was acknowledged on Twitter was around Christmas that year:  Thanks @CBC for cutting @realDonaldTrump out of Home Alone 2. \\u2014 Colt McCaullany???? @DENNISGRIMBLE December 22, 2015  Now, either 2015 happened to be the first year the CBC broadcasted the movie, which I highly doubt, or something happened between the 2014 CBC broadcast of Home Alone 2, and the 2015 CBC broadcast. One could argue that Trump wasn\\u2019t a political figure in the public\\u2019s conscious before 2015, but years prior he had been making headlines for publicly questioning Obama\\u2019s birth certificate\\u2014so I don\\u2019t think that excuse really works. Had his cameo been cut before then, I\\u2019m sure it would have been noticed.  Trump\\u2019s presidential bid appears to be the beginning of the folks at the CBC being triggered by Trump so badly that they actually had to edit him out of their broadcast of the film. I can\\u2019t decide if this is hilarious or sad.  Update January 2: Just to be clear, the CBC issued a formal statement saying Home Alone 2 was edited in 2014 when they first obtained the rights to the movie.  _____  Matt Margolis is the author of Trumping Obama: How President Trump Saved Us From Barack Obama\\u2019s Legacy and the bestselling book The Worst President in History: The Legacy of Barack Obama.

told missourinet that marshall wasn\\u2019t exactly correct about federal oversight of automatic weapons, citing 2011 legislation passed by state lawmakers known as house bill 294.  \\u201cpart of this omnibus gun bill that year legalizing machine guns in the state of missouri. we legalized them here. and ever since then, continually my whole time in the legislature, we have loosened restriction.\\u201d  newman also said voters have failed to hold lawmakers responsible for current laws which allow access to rapid fire weapons. \\u201cwe elect people and then expect them to change their spots when they are in office. they\\u2019re not going to do it because they\\u2019re answering to the gun lobby. the gun lobby only cares about more sales. that\\u2019s it\\u201d.  austin petersen, a republican candidate for the u.s. senate seat held by mccaskill, expressed sadness over the shooting and asked for unity in overcoming it.  \\u201ci\\u2019m heartbroken over the tragic event in las vegas yesterday,\\u201d petersen said. \\u201cthis horrendous act of violence touches and hurts us all as a nation and we must come together to heal and find answers. i send my most sincere condolences to all of the victims and their families. please help and love one another.\\u201d  petersen has criticized facebook for banning him from the site for 30 days after he posted a live stream video of himself talking about an ar-15 rifle he\\u2019s giving away. an ar-15 is a semi-automatic weapon.  during an interview with missourinet columbia affiliate kssz, petersen said ban was politically motivated. \\u201cfacebook\\u2019s chief operating officer sheryl sandberg has donated the maximum amount allowable to my opponent claire mccaskill, so something\\u2019s fishy.\\u201d  at least 58 people have died from sunday night\\u2019s mass shooting in las vegas, which also injured more than 500 people\",\n          \"leaked visitor logs reveal schiff\\u2019s 78 visits to epstein isle it\\u2019s no secret that epstein and schiff share a long history of perversion. last year, it was revealed by the fbi that the two corresponded by email on several occasions, totaling 256 emails. but, according to the latest leak, it goes much deeper than just emails.  the reasons for the visits were not recorded, but based on the emails between the two men, we can assume they were for nefarious reasons.  an fbi insider has leaked the extensive visitor logs to epstein isle. several notable names were mentioned in the log, including bill clinton, bill gates, jeff bezos, and nancy pelosi. but the most frequent visitor was none other than adam schiff, who visited 78 times over the span of five years.  chief inspector of the department of investigation, joe barron, gave his thoughts about the case, saying the details were sickening.  \\u201cwhat we have discovered over the past few months has been disturbing, to say the least. this goes to very very highest levels. no one could have predicted this. only the foil hats would have thought this to be possible. schiff looks to be the ringleader of the operation, arranging the trades and handled the financing. i can\\u2019t say anything else since it\\u2019s a nonexistent investigation, but rest assured justice will be served. in america, no one is above the law, except the rich.\\u201d  this is truly sickening news, but not unexpected. it was well-known that schiff and epstein were in cahoots, but the fact that epstein was one of the main figures behind the operation was unexpected. this explains the impeachment hoax, since he was looking for a distraction.  these people are in the highest levels of government and need to be found out and prosecuted.  we can\\u2019t have this type of behavior

The authorization was based on the FDA\\u2019s thorough and transparent evaluation of the data that included input from independent advisory committee experts who overwhelmingly voted in favor of making the vaccine available to children in this age group.  Key points for parents and caregivers:  Effectiveness: Immune responses of children 5 through 11 years of age were comparable to those of individuals 16 through 25 years of age. In addition, the vaccine was found to be 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19 in children 5 through 11.  Safety: The vaccine\\u2019s safety was studied in approximately 3,100 children age 5 through 11 who received the vaccine and no serious side effects have been detected in the ongoing study.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\u2019s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will meet next week to discuss further clinical recommendations.  \\u201cAs a mother and a physician, I know that parents, caregivers, school staff, and children have been waiting for today\\u2019s authorization. Vaccinating younger children against COVID-19 will bring us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy,\\u201d said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. \\u201cOur comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the data pertaining to the vaccine\\u2019s safety and effectiveness should help assure parents and guardians that this vaccine meets our high standards.\\u201d  The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children 5 through 11 years of age is administered as a two-dose primary series, 3 weeks apart, but is a lower dose (10 micrograms) than that used for individuals 12 years of age and older (30 micrograms).  In the U.S., COVID-19 cases in children 5 through 11 years of age make up 39% of cases in individuals younger than 18 years of age. According to the CDC, approximately 8,300 COVID-19 cases in children 5 through 11 years of age resulted in hospitalization. As of Oct. 17, 691 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported in the U.S. in individuals less than 18 years of age, with 146 deaths in the 5 through 11 years age group.  \\u201cThe FDA is committed to making decisions that are guided by science that the public and healthcare community can trust. We are confident in the safety, effectiveness and manufacturing data behind this authorization. As part of our commitment to transparency around our decision-making, which included our public advisory committee meeting earlier this week, we have posted documents today supporting our decision and additional information detailing our evaluation of the data will be posted soon. We hope this information helps build confidence of parents who are deciding whether to have their children vaccinated,\\u201d said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA\\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.  The FDA has determined this Pfizer vaccine has met the criteria for emergency use authorization. Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, the known and potential benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in individuals down to 5 years of age outweigh the known and potential risks.  FDA Evaluation of Available Effectiveness Data  The effectiveness data to support the EUA in children down to 5 years of age is based on an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled study that has enrolled approximately 4,700 children 5 through 11 years of age. The study is being conducted in the U.S., Finland, Poland and Spain. Children in the vaccine group received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine containing 10 micrograms of messenger RNA per dose. The FDA analyzed data that compared the immune response of 264 participants from this study to 253 participants 16 through 25 years of age who had two higher doses of the vaccine in a previous study which determined the vaccine to be effective in preventing COVID-19. The immune responses of the younger age participants were comparable to the older participants.  The FDA also conducted a preliminary analysis of cases of COVID-19 occurring seven days after the second dose. In this analysis, among participants without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, 3 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 1,305 vaccine recipients and 16 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 663 placebo recipients; the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19.  FDA Evaluation of Available Safety Data  The available safety data to support the EUA include more than 4,600 participants (3,100 vaccine, 1,538 placebo) ages 5 through 11 years enrolled in the ongoing study. In this trial, a total of 1,444 vaccine recipients were followed for safety for at least 2 months after the second dose.  Commonly reported side effects in the clinical trial included injection site pain (sore arm), redness and swelling, fatigue, headache, muscle and/or joint pain, chills, fever, swollen lymph nodes, nausea and decreased appetite. More children reported side effects after the second dose than after the first dose. Side effects were generally mild to moderate in severity and occurred within two days after vaccination, and most went away within one to two days.  The FDA and CDC safety surveillance systems have previously identified increased risks of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of tissue surrounding the heart) following vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, particularly following the second dose, and with the observed risk highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Therefore, the FDA conducted its own benefit-risk assessment using modelling to predict how many symptomatic COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths from COVID-19 the vaccine in children 5 through 11 years of age would prevent versus the number of potential myocarditis cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths that the vaccine might cause. The FDA\\u2019s model predicts that overall, the benefits of the vaccine would outweigh its risks in children 5 through 11 years of age.  Ongoing Safety Monitoring  Pfizer Inc. has updated its safety monitoring plan to include evaluation of myocarditis, pericarditis and other events of interest in children 5 through 11 years of age. In addition, the FDA and the CDC have several systems in place to continually monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety and allow for the rapid detection and investigation of potential safety problems.  It is mandatory for Pfizer Inc. and vaccination providers to report to any serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death in vaccinated individuals. It is also mandatory for vaccination providers to report all vaccine administration errors to VAERS for which they become aware and for Pfizer Inc. to include a summary and analysis of all identified vaccine administration errors in monthly safety reports to the FDA.  Data Supports New Vaccine Formulation to Improve Stability and Storage Conditions  The FDA today also authorized a manufacturing change for the vaccine to include a formulation that uses a different buffer; buffers help maintain a vaccine\\u2019s pH (a measure of how acidic or alkaline a solution is) and stability. This new formulation is more stable at refrigerated temperatures for longer periods of time, permitting greater flexibility for vaccination providers.  The new formulation of the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. contains Tris buffer, a commonly used buffer in a variety of other FDA-approved vaccines and other biologics, including products for use in children. The FDA evaluated manufacturing data to support the use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine containing Tris buffer and concluded it does not present safety or effectiveness concerns.  Related Information  ###  Boilerplate The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation\\u2019s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\",\n          \"A recent study from the Centers for Disease Control found mask mandates made less than a 2 percent difference in the daily death rates from the Chinese coronavirus and an even smaller percentage in case growth. From March 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020, the CDC found that in 2,313 American counties where mask mandates were issued, daily growth rates of the Chinese coronavirus decreased by only 0.5 percent in the first 20 days of being issued; they went down 1.8 percent within 81-100 days. Daily death growth rates from the virus decreased by 0.7 percent within the first 20 days of the mandates and 1.9 percent in 81-100 days. \\u201cDaily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period,\\u201d the CDC study states.

Cadena said. \\u201cPregnant people and their families deserve continued access to safe and legal abortion. By repealing this dangerous statute, we are making sure this ban is never enforceable in New Mexico again.\\u201d  \\u201cAbortion is health care, and all New Mexicans have a right to health care without politics interfering and without fear or penalty,\\u201d Rep. Ferrary said. \\u201cMedical decisions, especially those regarding reproductive care, are deeply personal and complex and should be made between a woman, her family and her doctor, to be guided by her own faith and values.\\u201d  \\u201cThe majority of New Mexicans believe that a woman\\u2019s right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion, should be protected. New Mexicans support abortion access and trust each other to make their own decisions,\\u201d Speaker Egolf said. \\u201cWith HB 7, we\\u2019re making sure that no matter what happens in Washington, DC, New Mexicans will always be able to make their own health care decisions.\\u201d  The 1969 New Mexico abortion ban became unenforceable following the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision; however, it is still in New Mexico state statute. HB 7 is a repeal of the 1969 ban, ensuring that these dangerous restrictions on reproductive health care will not be enforced in New Mexico should Roe v. Wade be overturned by a future Supreme Court.  House Bill 7 passed committee with a bipartisan 8-3 vote, and will now be heard in the House Judiciary Committee.  Members of the public can track legislation on the New Mexico Legislature website and access committee meetings and House floor sessions on the Webcasts tab. During the 2021 Legislative Session, the House of Representatives is focused on passing critical legislation while protecting the health and safety of the public, the staff, and the legislators.\",\n          \"New research of toxic bait might provide control of wild hog problem in Texas and other states The rapid and uncontrolled population growth of feral swine in Texas and other affected states has been a severe problem for at least the last decade, damages caused by the wild animals reaching into the millions just in Texas.  Nationally, feral swine cause major damage to property, agriculture crops and livestock, native species and ecosystems, and cultural and historic resources. This invasive species costs the United States an estimated $1.5 billion each year in damages and control costs.  Related: No end in sight for Texas' war against feral swine  In addition to these concerns, because of their very nature, feral swine, which wallow along river banks, lakes and ponds, are known to spread diseases to other types of wildlife, and domestic animals. Feral pigs are also becoming a problem in some suburban areas as they root up turf at homes, parks and golf courses. They also turn over and root through trash cans in suburban areas and pose a driving hazard when moving in large numbers near roadways and highways.  In recent years a major effort to control population numbers has helped, but wildlife and public health officials say more needs to be done. But with an estimated five million feral swine running free in the United States, controlling the problem appears to be greater than current efforts to manage their numbers.  Limited Control Options  Existing control methods include hunting and trapping the animals, but in spite of eliminating a considerable number of the animals, feral swine continue to spread into other states not previously known to be feeding or breeding grounds. Overall, 39 states have reported some level of problem with wild pigs.  Texas is home to more feral pigs than any other state \\u2014 an estimated 30 percent to 50 percent of all feral swine in the nation, according to USDA. More effort to reduce their numbers has occurred in Texas than anywhere else, representing more traps, more hunts, and more research. Yet their numbers are growing, and so is the amount of damage they cause each year.  In 2017 Texas Commissioner of Agriculture Sid Miller unveiled a wide-reaching plan to deal with the feral hog problem, calling for what he termed a hog-apocalypse involving the distribution of a deadly poison bait. Miller initially approved the legal use of a commercial poison that contained warfarin, the same drug used to kill rats or prescribed by doctors, in smaller doses, to prevent blood clots. Once feral swine ingest the poison, they begin to bleed internally. But hunters and conservationists expressed concern, fearing other animals may be exposed to the toxin, possibly affecting any animal or human predator feeding on the meat of a poisoned pig.  Shortly after announcing its use, the manufacturer of the poison bait voluntarily removed the product from the market out of fear of lawsuits and other possible retribution.  Toxic Bait Evaluation  Now, USDA\\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service APHIS is evaluating another type of oral toxic bait for use with invasive feral swine. APHIS received an Experimental Use Permit EUP from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to conduct sodium nitrite toxic bait field trials on free-roaming feral swine in Texas and Alabama last November, and signed a final environmental assessment and issued a Decision and Finding of No Significant Impact FONSI associated with conducting field trials using the poison.  Wildlife Services takes the selection and use of toxic baits for use in wildlife damage management very seriously. The final environmental assessments, FONSI and EUP, are the result of years of collaborative research by Wildlife Services and multiple private, state, federal and international partners, reports APHIS Wildlife Services WS Deputy Administrator Bill Clay. With these in place, we can now begin field trials to help determine the effectiveness of the sodium nitrite toxic bait for removing feral swine sounders in natural settings, as well as any potential impacts to non-target wildlife.  Safeguards  Clay says the EUP allows researchers to partner with landowners to identify and target three to nine feral swine sounders herds each in Texas and Alabama. He said bait delivery systems designed to prevent access by non-target wildlife will be filled with placebo bait, placed in the sounders\\u2019 territories and monitored with motion-activated cameras.  Following a period of acclimation to confirm feral swine use of the baiting areas, the placebo bait will be replaced with sodium nitrite toxic bait for two nights. As a research method, at least 30 feral swine and no more than 30 raccoons in each state\\u2019s study area are to be captured live and radio-collared prior to baiting in order to monitor their movements and exposure to the bait. Landowners within 300 meters of bait stations will be notified, and signs will be placed on bait stations and along roads leading into the study areas.  Sodium nitrite NaNO2 is a meat preservative commonly used to cure meats such as sausage and bacon. When eaten in high doses over a short period of time, it is toxic to feral swine. The mode of death is similar to carbon monoxide poisoning. Once enough sodium nitrite bait is eaten, the feral swine gets faint, is rendered unconscious, and quickly dies. In most cases, feral swine die within two and-a-half to three hours after eating a lethal dose, Clay said.  Researchers say many factors are considered when developing a toxic bait for feral swine. Not only must it be effective and humane in eliminating feral swine, but also must be low risk for those handling it, the environment, and wildlife. Other wildlife, such as raccoons, bears and deer, may be attracted to the sodium nitrite toxic bait, but to prevent non-target species from accessing it, researchers will use delivery systems and baiting strategies designed to target feral swine. Trials will not be conducted in areas with known black bear populations.  The trials are scheduled to begin in both Alabama and Texas as early as February.  Although trapping, aerial operations, and recreational hunting of feral swine have effectively reduced damage in some areas, studies show that at least 70 percent of feral swine must be removed each year in order to prevent population growth, Clay said. Should the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approve the toxic bait for use with feral swine, it could become another tool in the toolbox for integrated feral swine damage management.  Skeptics  While farmers welcome technology that helps to control the damaging swine in their fields, there are skeptics.  Roland Ortiz, a commercial trapper and hunter in the San Antonio area, says wild hogs are very intelligent creatures, and they are prolific breeders. Ortiz stays busy hunting and trapping hogs on farms, ranches and lately in subdivisions that contract his services.  We are slowly pushing back into more sparsely populated areas, but they keep coming back. Managing them is a full time job, Ortiz said.  While he agrees a toxic bait would help to control wild swine populations, he doubts anything will ever solve the problem.  We have rat poison, but there's still lots of rats, Ortiz notes.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

communist party **membership** list nation  u.s. state governors names on china communist party **membership** list  a database obtained by computer hackers from china communist party computers allegedly reveals the names of more than a dozen u.s. state governors who are reportedly shown in the database as being members of china's communist party:  the database was originally leaked on telegram, the encrypted instant messaging app, and passed in september by a chinese dissident to the inter-parliamentary alliance on china, which comprises more than 150 legislators around the world who are concerned by the influence and activities of the chinese government. here is a statement from ipac about the data:  detailed analysis by u.s. intelligence sources say the list is genuine!  the list mostly includes the details of ccp members based in shanghai, in more than 79,000 branches, or cells. the ccp's total membership currently stands at more than 92 million, with a success rate of around 10 percent for aspiring members.  china communist party (ccp) members have infiltrated not only some of the largest corporations of the us, australia and the uk, but also many consulates and government agencies, giving them access to sensitive and no doubt compromising information that would give the ccp an edge on the world stage.  make no mistake, these agents ultimately answer directly to the party and chairman xi jinping.  this is a fascinating look inside the ccp\\u2019s infiltration network and gives us an idea of just how deeply their agents have been embedded.  the original database in chinese contains some 1.95 million names, the majority from shanghai, many complete with national id number & personal details, but also contains the details of some 79,000 communist party branches, many of them inside the companies they have infiltrated. some of the names are listed as having been \\u201cexecuted\\u201d while others have notes regarding organs and a price.  take a quick look at how the ccp works:  georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger who ran what may be the most fraudulent election in the nation on november 3, where president trump lost the traditionally red state, has a brother. meet brother, ron raffensperger cto for huawei enterprise storage solutions, the data storage company of . . . . the ccp.  the same chinese communist party (ccp) that paid dominion $400 million through a subsidiary of hsbc, a month or so before the november 3 election, which may have gotten the ccp the ability to \\\"update\\\" dominion voting software for the then-upcoming u.s. presidential election!  elsewhere, other key people are tunring out to have strong connections to the ccp. michigan secretary of state jocelyn benson \\u2013 currently obstructing efforts to investigate michigan\\u2019s election results \\u2013 developed ties with chinese state-run universities and trained lawyers for the chinese communist party \\u2013 even delivering a lecture at chinese premier xi jinping\\u2019s alma mater.    benson undertook the work aiding the chinese communist party while serving as the dean of wayne law school in detroit, michigan.  being the cto for a mega corporation like huawei pays huge bucks. maybe some of that money is going to a certain secretary of state? who knows what's happening between the two brothers . . . maybe at the behest of the ccp?  china's infiltration efforts have been vast. major aerospace companies airbus, rolls-royce, and boeing have employed hundreds of ccp members. additionally, pfizer and british drugmaker astrazeneca (covid-19 vaccine developer!) employed a total of 123 party members. british automaker jaguar land rover also employed ccp members.  now, back to the usa. the governors allegedly named in the database are listed below:    az - ducey    ar - hutchinson    ca - newsome    ct - lamont    nm - grisham    vt - scott    ia - reynolds    ri - raimondo    ne - ricketts    de - carney    in - holcomb    nv - sisolak    tn - lee    ky - beshear    id - little    mt - bullock    or - brown    il - pritzker    la - edwards    tx - abbott    mn - waltz    ma- baker  nc-cooper    ut - herbert  other names totaling 1.9 million people, are also on the list, which is still being sorted and translated. the process of translating is taking longer than expected, but it looks like this: (click image to enlarge)  pompeo warned them all  earlier this year, u.s. secretary of state, mike pompeo, spoke at the national governor's association winter meeting and he warned governors they were being targeted by china. he told the governors that china was doing harm to the us and to our industries, and they were moving to manipulate governors into doing things that would help china at the expense of america. pompeo warned them all to be careful.  the warning apparently came too late because based on the information outlined above, obtained from computer hackers, it seems that several u.s. state governors may have already sold-out and become communists.  communism illegal in the united states  the communist party is unlawful in the united states. it's very existence is banned by federal law. here is the law:  of course, while the federal law above bans the communist party of the united states, it does not ban the communist party of china. the question then becomes, have these governors become members of the china communist party (ccp) for the same purpose as that previously espoused by the communist party of the united states? same political ideology . . . same goal?  folks who live in states whose governor's name appears on the ccp member list, need to make a major fuss about this and find out what's what.  if your governor is a communist, then your governor has to go.  now.  no exceptions.  now that you have read this story, please cover the cost for what your visit cost this site by clicking one or more of the ads below

for information and broadcasting farrukh habib on tuesday described the pakistan muslim league-nawaz\\u2019s (pml-n) criticism on the pakistan media development authority (pmda) as \\u2018unfounded\\u2019.  \\u201cconsultative process on the pmda\\u2019s framework is underway. the pml-n\\u2019s criticism on it is beyond comprehension,\\u201d he said in a news release while reacting to pml-n spokesperson marriyum aurangzeb\\u2019s statement.  \\u201cthere will be no restriction on media freedom [with establishment of pmda,\\u201d farrukh said while lashing out at those who were trying to mislead the people with interpretation of pmda according to their own whims.  he criticized the opposition for resorting to political point-scoring on the pmda without reading draft of its framework.  farrukh chided marriyum for criticizing the pmda and said she did not even bother to attend joint meeting of the standing committee on information and broadcasting.  he said all the media forums including all pakistan newspapers society (apns), council of pakistan newspaper editors (cpne), pakistan broadcasters association (pba), press clubs and other stakeholders had been made part of the consultative process.  all the stakeholders assured full support on the steps that would ensure journalists and media workers\\u2019 job security and in-time salaries and regulation of digital media, he added.  he said in the past, it was tradition of enacting laws overnight, adding it was the present government which had set a precedent of holding consultation with stakeholders before drafting laws.  farrukh said everybody including media knew as to how the pml-n dealt with media during their tenure of government in the country.  the minister said the pmda framework was being developed in the same manner that the developed countries had adopted to deal with the challenges stemming from the evolutionary process of media.  he said the pmda would not only regulate digital media and develop the industry in an effective manner, but also ensure freedom of expression and protection of journalists\\u2019 rights. it would also ensure job security and in-time issuance of salaries of journalists and media workers, he added.  the pmda was meant for bringing all the concerned agencies under one umbrella to facilitate the journalists and workers of all forms of the media in an efficient manner, farrukh noted.  he said previously, there was no platform for resolution of electronic media\\u2019s journalists and workers\\u2019 problems.  the minister said the pmda was being set up to make media-related institutions more efficient and effective. the present government firmly believed in freedom of the media and expression as enshrined in article 19 of the constitution.  in the past, he said there were instances when the pakistan tehreek-e-insaf fully participated in the movements launched for independence of the judiciary and media in the country.\",\n          \"kremlin: putin\\u2019s 'heaven' remark symbolism, russia rejects notion of preemptive strike milwaukee emerged as america's fourth-most impoverished big city in 2009, as the great recession rippled across the city and state, according to u.s. census bureau figures released tuesday. milwaukee's poverty rate reached 27%, up from 23.4% in the previous year. only detroit (36.4%), cleveland (35%) and buffalo (28.8%) had higher poverty rates among cities with populations greater than 250,000. milwaukee was ranked 11th in 2008. an estimated 158,245 milwaukeeans lived in poverty last year. for a family of four with two adults and two children, the poverty threshold was an annual income of $21,954. what's more, nearly 4 in 10 children in milwaukee were considered poor, meaning an estimated 62,432 children lived in poverty last year, up from 49,952 in 2008. milwaukee mayor tom barrett, a democrat who is running for governor, said the poverty numbers \\\"are unacceptable and should be of concern to everyone in the community and the state.\\\" \\\"they obviously are in part a result of the global economic downturn which has disproportionately affected lower incomes,\\\" he said. \\\"but it has also sent lower middle-class people into poverty as well. it explains why we're looking so aggressive to create more jobs, tackle the issues of education, workforce development and transportation.\\\" milwaukee county executive scott walker, the republican candidate for governor, said the \\\"anti-business\\\" policies of democrats barrett and sitting governor jim doyle have directly affected \\\"the poverty levels in milwaukee and cities across our state.\\\" \\\"as governor, i'll work to get government out of the way so we can help struggling families and bring 250,000 jobs to wisconsin,\\\" walker said in a statement. barrett disputed walker's assertion and said, \\\"i have never seen any signs that he is interested in addressing the poverty issues in our community, period.\\\" he said that jobs provide the best remedy for alleviating poverty and added that he would prefer the issue not be politicized. \\\"i wish this is one (issue) we could reach across the aisle and work together,\\\" barrett said. michael bonds, president of the milwaukee school board, said he was not surprised by the newest poverty figures. \\\"i think we're at a critical point when we're starting to see some of the broader things in the community impacting students,\\\" he said. \\\"not only do schools have to deal with traditional education, but now they also have to provide supports that were traditionally provided by other agencies, because those institutions are also facing financial challenges,\\\" he added. bonds said he doesn't see any quick-fix to bring children out of poverty in milwaukee. \\\"some areas of the city, you see african-american unemployment reaching 60% to 70%,\\\" he said. marc levine, executive director of the center for economic development at the university of wisconsin-milwaukee, said the latest census data reflect the city's lack of job growth. \\\"our analysis of employment data shows that milwaukee has had among the worst job creation records of any big city in the u.s. for over a decade, so it is not surprising that poverty numbers have worsened, especially during the worst recession since the great depression,\\\" levine said. hard times didn't hit just in milwaukee. real median household income in the state declined between 2008 and 2009 - decreasing by 3.8% from $51,942 to $49,993. poverty also surged statewide from 10.4% to 12.4% in 2009. there were an estimated 570,583 people in poverty in the state in 2008 and 683,408 people in poverty in 2009. nationally, poverty increased from 38.3 million people in 2008 to 42.8 million in 2009. ken taylor, executive director of the wisconsin council on children and families, labeled the poverty numbers as \\\"brutal\\\" and said they \\\"confirm our worst fears about the reality of the recession on kids.\\\" \\\"the idea that what happens in milwaukee doesn't influence ozaukee county is a fallacy,\\\" he said. \\\"we're all affected across the state by the challenges in milwaukee.\\\" in the suburbs outside milwaukee, the poverty rates were much lower, led by waukesha county (4.8%) while ozaukee (5.3%) and washington (5.4%) counties were not much higher. the poverty rates in those counties all increased at least 1 percentage point. the results come from the american community survey, which provides a snapshot of the nation's socioeconomic, housing and demographic characteristics. later this year, the census bureau will release the first results from the 2010 census, the complete count of every person in the

Limited Control Options exist control method include hunt and trap the animal , but in spite of eliminate a considerable number of the animal , feral swine continue to spread into other state not previously know to be feed or breeding ground . overall , 39 state have report some level of problem with wild pig . Texas be home to more feral pig than any other state \\u2014 an estimate 30 percent to 50 percent of all feral swine in the nation , accord to USDA . More effort to reduce their number have occur in Texas than anywhere else , represent more trap , more hunt , and more research . yet their number be grow , and so be the amount of damage they cause each year . in 2017 Texas Commissioner of Agriculture Sid Miller unveil a wide - reach plan to deal with the feral hog problem , call for what he term a hog - apocalypse involve the distribution of a deadly poison bait . Miller initially approve the legal use of a commercial poison that contain warfarin , the same drug use to kill rat or prescribe by doctor , in small dose , to prevent blood clot . once feral swine ingest the poison , they begin to bleed internally . but hunter and conservationist express concern , fear other animal may be expose to the toxin , possibly affect any animal or human predator feed on the meat of a poison pig . shortly after announce it use , the manufacturer of the poison bait voluntarily remove the product from the market out of fear of lawsuit and other possible retribution . Toxic Bait Evaluation now , USDA \\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service APHIS be evaluate another type of oral toxic bait for use with invasive feral swine . aphis receive an Experimental Use Permit eup from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to conduct sodium nitrite toxic bait field trial on free - roaming feral swine in Texas and Alabama last November , and sign a final environmental assessment and issue a decision and finding of no Significant Impact FONSI associate with conduct field trial use the poison . Wildlife Services take the selection and use of toxic bait for use in wildlife damage management very seriously . the final environmental assessment , FONSI and EUP , be the result of year of collaborative research by Wildlife Services and multiple private , state , federal and international partner , report APHIS Wildlife Services WS Deputy Administrator Bill Clay . with these in place , we can now begin field trial to help determine the effectiveness of the sodium nitrite toxic bait for remove feral swine sounder in natural setting , a well a any potential impact to non - target wildlife . Safeguards Clay say the eup allow researcher to partner with landowner to identify and target three to nine feral swine sounder herd each in Texas and Alabama . he say bait delivery system design to prevent access by non - target wildlife will be fill with placebo bait , place in the sounder \\u2019 territory and monitor with motion - activate camera . follow a period of acclimation to confirm feral swine use of the baiting area , the placebo bait will be replace with sodium nitrite toxic bait for two night . a a research method , at least 30 feral swine and no more than 30 raccoon in each state \\u2019s study area be to be capture live and radio - collar prior to bait in order to monitor their movement and exposure to the bait . landowner within 300 meter of bait station will be notify , and sign will be place on bait station and along road lead into the study area . Sodium nitrite NaNO2 be a meat preservative commonly use to cure meat such a sausage and bacon . when eat in high dose over a short period of time , it be toxic to feral swine . the mode of death be similar to carbon monoxide poisoning . once enough sodium nitrite bait be eat , the feral swine get faint , be render unconscious , and quickly die . in most case , feral swine die within two and - a - half to three hour after eat a lethal dose , Clay say . researcher say many factor be consider when develop a toxic bait for feral swine . not only must it be effective and humane in eliminate feral swine , but also must be low risk for those handle it , the environment , and wildlife . other wildlife , such a raccoon , bear and deer , may be attract to the sodium nitrite toxic bait , but to prevent non - target specie from access it , researcher will use delivery system and bait strategy design to target feral swine . trial will not be conduct in area with know black bear population . the trial be schedule to begin in both Alabama and Texas a early a February . although trapping , aerial operation , and recreational hunting of feral swine have effectively reduce damage in some area , study show that at least 70 percent of feral swine must be remove each year in order to prevent population growth , Clay say . should the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approve the toxic bait for use with feral swine , it could become another tool in the toolbox for integrate feral swine damage management . skeptic while farmer welcome technology that help to control the damage swine in their field , there be skeptic . Roland Ortiz , a commercial trapper and hunter in the San Antonio area , say wild hog be very intelligent creature , and they be prolific breeder . Ortiz stay busy hunt and trap hog on farm , ranch and lately in subdivision that contract his service . we be slowly push back into more sparsely populated area , but they keep come back . manage they be a full time job , Ortiz say . while he agree a toxic bait would help to control wild swine population , he doubt anything will ever solve the problem . we have rat poison , but there be still lot of rat , Ortiz note .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"combined_with_all\",\n      \"properties\": {\n
