Key points for parents and caregivers:  Effectiveness: Immune responses of children 5 through 11 years of age were comparable to those of individuals 16 through 25 years of age. In addition, the vaccine was found to be 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19 in children 5 through 11.  Safety: The vaccine\\u2019s safety was studied in approximately 3,100 children age 5 through 11 who received the vaccine and no serious side effects have been detected in the ongoing study.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\u2019s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will meet next week to discuss further clinical recommendations.  \\u201cAs a mother and a physician, I know that parents, caregivers, school staff, and children have been waiting for today\\u2019s authorization. Vaccinating younger children against COVID-19 will bring us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy,\\u201d said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. \\u201cOur comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the data pertaining to the vaccine\\u2019s safety and effectiveness should help assure parents and guardians that this vaccine meets our high standards.\\u201d  The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children 5 through 11 years of age is administered as a two-dose primary series, 3 weeks apart, but is a lower dose (10 micrograms) than that used for individuals 12 years of age and older (30 micrograms).  In the U.S., COVID-19 cases in children 5 through 11 years of age make up 39% of cases in individuals younger than 18 years of age. According to the CDC, approximately 8,300 COVID-19 cases in children 5 through 11 years of age resulted in hospitalization. As of Oct. 17, 691 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported in the U.S. in individuals less than 18 years of age, with 146 deaths in the 5 through 11 years age group.  \\u201cThe FDA is committed to making decisions that are guided by science that the public and healthcare community can trust. We are confident in the safety, effectiveness and manufacturing data behind this authorization. As part of our commitment to transparency around our decision-making, which included our public advisory committee meeting earlier this week, we have posted documents today supporting our decision and additional information detailing our evaluation of the data will be posted soon. We hope this information helps build confidence of parents who are deciding whether to have their children vaccinated,\\u201d said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA\\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.  The FDA has determined this Pfizer vaccine has met the criteria for emergency use authorization. Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, the known and potential benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in individuals down to 5 years of age outweigh the known and potential risks.  FDA Evaluation of Available Effectiveness Data  The effectiveness data to support the EUA in children down to 5 years of age is based on an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled study that has enrolled approximately 4,700 children 5 through 11 years of age. The study is being conducted in the U.S., Finland, Poland and Spain. Children in the vaccine group received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine containing 10 micrograms of messenger RNA per dose. The FDA analyzed data that compared the immune response of 264 participants from this study to 253 participants 16 through 25 years of age who had two higher doses of the vaccine in a previous study which determined the vaccine to be effective in preventing COVID-19. The immune responses of the younger age participants were comparable to the older participants.  The FDA also conducted a preliminary analysis of cases of COVID-19 occurring seven days after the second dose. In this analysis, among participants without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, 3 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 1,305 vaccine recipients and 16 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 663 placebo recipients; the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19.  FDA Evaluation of Available Safety Data  The available safety data to support the EUA include more than 4,600 participants (3,100 vaccine, 1,538 placebo) ages 5 through 11 years enrolled in the ongoing study. In this trial, a total of 1,444 vaccine recipients were followed for safety for at least 2 months after the second dose.  Commonly reported side effects in the clinical trial included injection site pain (sore arm), redness and swelling, fatigue, headache, muscle and/or joint pain, chills, fever, swollen lymph nodes, nausea and decreased appetite. More children reported side effects after the second dose than after the first dose. Side effects were generally mild to moderate in severity and occurred within two days after vaccination, and most went away within one to two days.  The FDA and CDC safety surveillance systems have previously identified increased risks of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of tissue surrounding the heart) following vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, particularly following the second dose, and with the observed risk highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Therefore, the FDA conducted its own benefit-risk assessment using modelling to predict how many symptomatic COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths from COVID-19 the vaccine in children 5 through 11 years of age would prevent versus the number of potential myocarditis cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths that the vaccine might cause. The FDA\\u2019s model predicts that overall, the benefits of the vaccine would outweigh its risks in children 5 through 11 years of age.  Ongoing Safety Monitoring  Pfizer Inc. has updated its safety monitoring plan to include evaluation of myocarditis, pericarditis and other events of interest in children 5 through 11 years of age. In addition, the FDA and the CDC have several systems in place to continually monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety and allow for the rapid detection and investigation of potential safety problems.  It is mandatory for Pfizer Inc. and vaccination providers to report to any serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death in vaccinated individuals. It is also mandatory for vaccination providers to report all vaccine administration errors to VAERS for which they become aware and for Pfizer Inc. to include a summary and analysis of all identified vaccine administration errors in monthly safety reports to the FDA.  Data Supports New Vaccine Formulation to Improve Stability and Storage Conditions  The FDA today also authorized a manufacturing change for the vaccine to include a formulation that uses a different buffer; buffers help maintain a vaccine\\u2019s pH (a measure of how acidic or alkaline a solution is) and stability. This new formulation is more stable at refrigerated temperatures for longer periods of time, permitting greater flexibility for vaccination providers.  The new formulation of the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. contains Tris buffer, a commonly used buffer in a variety of other FDA-approved vaccines and other biologics, including products for use in children. The FDA evaluated manufacturing data to support the use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine containing Tris buffer and concluded it does not present safety or effectiveness concerns.

House Bill 7 is sponsored by Speaker of the House Brian Egolf (D-Santa Fe),  Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena (D-Mesilla), Rep. Joanne Ferrary (D-Las Cruces), Rep. Deborah Armstrong (D-Albuquerque) and Rep. Georgene Louis (D-Albuquerque).  \\u201cHouse Bill 7 simply repeals the outdated and dangerous abortion ban of 1969 that was designed to keep New Mexicans from accessing the health care they may need,\\u201d Rep.

Nationally, feral swine cause major damage to property, agriculture crops and livestock, native species and ecosystems, and cultural and historic resources. This invasive species costs the United States an estimated $1.5 billion each year in damages and control costs.  Related: No end in sight for Texas' war against feral swine  In addition to these concerns, because of their very nature, feral swine, which wallow along river banks, lakes and ponds, are known to spread diseases to other types of wildlife, and domestic animals. Feral pigs are also becoming a problem in some suburban areas as they root up turf at homes, parks and golf courses. They also turn over and root through trash cans in suburban areas and pose a driving hazard when moving in large numbers near roadways and highways.  In recent years a major effort to control population numbers has helped, but wildlife and public health officials say more needs to be done. But with an estimated five million feral swine running free in the United States, controlling the problem appears to be greater than current efforts to manage their numbers.  Limited Control Options  Existing control methods include hunting and trapping the animals, but in spite of eliminating a considerable number of the animals, feral swine continue to spread into other states not previously known to be feeding or breeding grounds. Overall, 39 states have reported some level of problem with wild pigs.  Texas is home to more feral pigs than any other state \\u2014 an estimated 30 percent to 50 percent of all feral swine in the nation, according to USDA. More effort to reduce their numbers has occurred in Texas than anywhere else, representing more traps, more hunts, and more research. Yet their numbers are growing, and so is the amount of damage they cause each year.  In 2017 Texas Commissioner of Agriculture Sid Miller unveiled a wide-reaching plan to deal with the feral hog problem, calling for what he termed a hog-apocalypse involving the distribution of a deadly poison bait. Miller initially approved the legal use of a commercial poison that contained warfarin, the same drug used to kill rats or prescribed by doctors, in smaller doses, to prevent blood clots. Once feral swine ingest the poison, they begin to bleed internally. But hunters and conservationists expressed concern, fearing other animals may be exposed to the toxin, possibly affecting any animal or human predator feeding on the meat of a poisoned pig.  Shortly after announcing its use, the manufacturer of the poison bait voluntarily removed the product from the market out of fear of lawsuits and other possible retribution.  Toxic Bait Evaluation  Now, USDA\\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service APHIS is evaluating another type of oral toxic bait for use with invasive feral swine. APHIS received an Experimental Use Permit EUP from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to conduct sodium nitrite toxic bait field trials on free-roaming feral swine in Texas and Alabama last November, and signed a final environmental assessment and issued a Decision and Finding of No Significant Impact FONSI associated with conducting field trials using the poison.  Wildlife Services takes the selection and use of toxic baits for use in wildlife damage management very seriously. The final environmental assessments, FONSI and EUP, are the result of years of collaborative research by Wildlife Services and multiple private, state, federal and international partners, reports APHIS Wildlife Services WS Deputy Administrator Bill Clay. With these in place, we can now begin field trials to help determine the effectiveness of the sodium nitrite toxic bait for removing feral swine sounders in natural settings, as well as any potential impacts to non-target wildlife.  Safeguards  Clay says the EUP allows researchers to partner with landowners to identify and target three to nine feral swine sounders herds each in Texas and Alabama. He said bait delivery systems designed to prevent access by non-target wildlife will be filled with placebo bait, placed in the sounders\\u2019 territories and monitored with motion-activated cameras.  Following a period of acclimation to confirm feral swine use of the baiting areas, the placebo bait will be replaced with sodium nitrite toxic bait for two nights. As a research method, at least 30 feral swine and no more than 30 raccoons in each state\\u2019s study area are to be captured live and radio-collared prior to baiting in order to monitor their movements and exposure to the bait. Landowners within 300 meters of bait stations will be notified, and signs will be placed on bait stations and along roads leading into the study areas.  Sodium nitrite NaNO2 is a meat preservative commonly used to cure meats such as sausage and bacon. When eaten in high doses over a short period of time, it is toxic to feral swine. The mode of death is similar to carbon monoxide poisoning. Once enough sodium nitrite bait is eaten, the feral swine gets faint, is rendered unconscious, and quickly dies. In most cases, feral swine die within two and-a-half to three hours after eating a lethal dose, Clay said.  Researchers say many factors are considered when developing a toxic bait for feral swine. Not only must it be effective and humane in eliminating feral swine, but also must be low risk for those handling it, the environment, and wildlife. Other wildlife, such as raccoons, bears and deer, may be attracted to the sodium nitrite toxic bait, but to prevent non-target species from accessing it, researchers will use delivery systems and baiting strategies designed to target feral swine. Trials will not be conducted in areas with known black bear populations.  The trials are scheduled to begin in both Alabama and Texas as early as February.  Although trapping, aerial operations, and recreational hunting of feral swine have effectively reduced damage in some areas, studies show that at least 70 percent of feral swine must be removed each year in order to prevent population growth, Clay said. Should the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approve the toxic bait for use with feral swine, it could become another tool in the toolbox for integrated feral swine damage management.  Skeptics  While farmers welcome technology that helps to control the damaging swine in their fields, there are skeptics.  Roland Ortiz, a commercial trapper and hunter in the San Antonio area, says wild hogs are very intelligent creatures, and they are prolific breeders. Ortiz stays busy hunting and trapping hogs on farms, ranches and lately in subdivisions that contract his services.  We are slowly pushing back into more sparsely populated areas, but they keep coming back. Managing them is a full time job, Ortiz said.  While he agrees a toxic bait would help to control wild swine populations, he doubts anything will ever solve the problem.  We have rat poison, but there's still lots of rats, Ortiz notes.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

telegram, the encrypted instant messaging app, and passed in september by a chinese dissident to the inter-parliamentary alliance on china, which comprises more than 150 legislators around the world who are concerned by the influence and activities of the chinese government. here is a statement from ipac about the data:  detailed analysis by u.s. intelligence sources say the list is genuine!  the list mostly includes the details of ccp members based in shanghai, in more than 79,000 branches, or cells. the ccp's total membership currently stands at more than 92 million, with a success rate of around 10 percent for aspiring members.  china communist party (ccp) members have infiltrated not only some of the largest corporations of the us, australia and the uk, but also many consulates and government agencies, giving them access to sensitive and no doubt compromising information that would give the ccp an edge on the world stage.  make no mistake, these agents ultimately answer directly to the party and chairman xi jinping.  this is a fascinating look inside the ccp\\u2019s infiltration network and gives us an idea of just how deeply their agents have been embedded.  the original database in chinese contains some 1.95 million names, the majority from shanghai, many complete with national id number & personal details, but also contains the details of some 79,000 communist party branches, many of them inside the companies they have infiltrated. some of the names are listed as having been \\u201cexecuted\\u201d while others have notes regarding organs and a price.  take a quick look at how the ccp works:  georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger who ran what may be the most fraudulent election in the nation on november 3, where president trump lost the traditionally red state, has a brother. meet brother, ron raffensperger cto for huawei enterprise storage solutions, the data storage company of . . . . the ccp.  the same chinese communist party (ccp) that paid dominion $400 million through a subsidiary of hsbc, a month or so before the november 3 election, which may have gotten the ccp the ability to \\\"update\\\" dominion voting software

michigan.  being the cto for a mega corporation like huawei pays huge bucks. maybe some of that money is going to a certain secretary of state? who knows what's happening between the two brothers . . . maybe at the behest of the ccp?  china's infiltration efforts have been vast. major aerospace companies airbus, rolls-royce, and boeing have employed hundreds of ccp members. additionally, pfizer and british drugmaker astrazeneca (covid-19 vaccine developer!) employed a total of 123 party members. british automaker jaguar land rover also employed ccp members.  now, back to the usa. the

baker  nc-cooper    ut - herbert  other names totaling 1.9 million people, are also on the list, which is still being sorted and translated. the process of translating is taking longer than expected, but it looks like this: (click image to enlarge)  pompeo warned them all  earlier this year, u.s. secretary of state, mike pompeo, spoke at the national governor's association winter meeting and he warned governors they were being targeted by china. he told the governors that china was doing harm to the us and to our industries, and they were moving to manipulate governors into doing things that would help china at the expense of america. pompeo warned them all to be careful.  the warning apparently came too late because based on the information outlined above, obtained from computer hackers, it seems that several u.s. state governors may have already sold-out and become communists.  communism illegal in the united states  the communist party is unlawful in the united states. it's very existence is banned by federal law. here is the law:  of course, while the federal law above bans the communist party of the united states, it does not ban the communist party of china. the question then becomes, have these governors become members of the china communist party (ccp) for the same purpose as that previously espoused by the communist party of the united states? same political ideology . . . same goal?  folks who live in states whose governor's name appears on the ccp member list, need to make a major fuss about this and find out what's what.  if your governor is a

for information and broadcasting farrukh habib on tuesday described the pakistan muslim league-nawaz\\u2019s (pml-n) criticism on the pakistan media development authority (pmda) as \\u2018unfounded\\u2019.  \\u201cconsultative process on the pmda\\u2019s framework is underway. the pml-n\\u2019s criticism on it is beyond comprehension,\\u201d he said in a news release while reacting to pml-n spokesperson marriyum aurangzeb\\u2019s statement.  \\u201cthere will be no restriction on media freedom [with establishment of pmda,\\u201d farrukh said while lashing out at those who were trying to mislead the people with interpretation of pmda according to their own whims.  he criticized the opposition for resorting to political point-scoring on the pmda without reading draft of its framework.  farrukh chided marriyum for criticizing the pmda and said she did not even bother to attend joint meeting of the standing committee on information and broadcasting.  he said all the media forums including all pakistan newspapers society (apns), council of pakistan newspaper editors (cpne), pakistan broadcasters association (pba), press clubs and other stakeholders had been made part of the consultative process.  all the stakeholders assured full support on the steps that would ensure journalists and media workers\\u2019 job security and in-time salaries and regulation of digital media, he added.  he said in the past, it was tradition of enacting laws overnight, adding it was the present government which had set a precedent of holding consultation with stakeholders before drafting laws.  farrukh said everybody including media knew as to how the pml-n dealt with media during their tenure of government in the country.  the minister said the pmda framework was being developed in the same manner that the developed countries had adopted to deal with the challenges stemming from the evolutionary process of media.  he said the pmda would not only regulate digital media and develop the industry in an effective manner, but also ensure freedom of expression and protection of journalists\\u2019 rights. it would also ensure job security and in-time issuance of salaries of journalists and media workers, he added.  the pmda was meant for bringing all the concerned agencies under one umbrella to facilitate the journalists and workers of all forms of the media in an efficient manner, farrukh noted.  he said previously, there was no platform for resolution of electronic media\\u2019s journalists and workers\\u2019 problems.  the minister said the pmda was being set up to make media-related institutions more efficient and effective. the present government firmly believed in freedom of the media and expression as enshrined in article 19 of the constitution.  in the past, he said there were instances when the pakistan tehreek-e-insaf fully participated in the movements launched for independence of the judiciary and media in the country.\",\n          \"kremlin: putin\\u2019s 'heaven' remark symbolism, russia rejects notion of preemptive strike milwaukee emerged as america's fourth-most impoverished big city in 2009, as the great recession rippled across the city and state, according to u.s. census bureau figures released tuesday. milwaukee's poverty rate reached 27%, up from 23.4% in the previous year. only detroit (36.4%), cleveland (35%) and buffalo (28.8%) had higher poverty rates among cities with populations greater than 250,000. milwaukee was ranked 11th in 2008. an estimated 158,245 milwaukeeans lived in poverty last year. for a family of four with two adults and two children, the poverty threshold was an annual income of $21,954. what's more, nearly 4 in 10 children in milwaukee were considered poor, meaning an estimated 62,432 children lived in poverty last year, up from 49,952 in 2008. milwaukee mayor tom barrett, a democrat who is running for governor, said the poverty numbers \\\"are unacceptable and should be of concern to everyone in the community and the state.\\\" \\\"they obviously are in part a result of the global economic downturn which has disproportionately affected lower incomes,\\\" he said. \\\"but it has also sent lower middle-class people into poverty as well. it explains why we're looking so aggressive to create more jobs, tackle the issues of education, workforce development and transportation.\\\" milwaukee county executive scott walker, the republican candidate for governor, said the \\\"anti-business\\\" policies of democrats barrett and sitting governor jim doyle have directly affected \\\"the poverty levels in milwaukee and cities across our state.\\\" \\\"as governor, i'll work to get government out of the way so we can help struggling families and bring 250,000 jobs to wisconsin,\\\" walker said in a statement. barrett disputed walker's assertion and said, \\\"i have never seen any signs that he is interested in addressing the poverty issues in our community, period.\\\" he said that jobs provide the best remedy for alleviating poverty and added that he would prefer the issue not be politicized. \\\"i wish this is one (issue) we could reach across the aisle and work together,\\\" barrett said. michael bonds, president of the milwaukee school board, said he was not surprised by the newest poverty figures. \\\"i think we're at a critical point when we're starting to see some of the broader things in the community impacting students,\\\" he said. \\\"not only do schools have to deal with traditional education, but now they also have to provide supports that were traditionally provided by other agencies, because those institutions are also facing financial challenges,\\\" he added. bonds said he doesn't see any quick-fix to bring children out of poverty in milwaukee. \\\"some areas of the city, you see african-american unemployment reaching 60% to 70%,\\\" he said. marc levine, executive director of the center for economic development at the university of wisconsin-milwaukee, said the latest census data reflect the city's lack of job growth. \\\"our analysis of employment data shows that milwaukee has had among the worst job creation records of any big city in the u.s. for over a decade, so it is not surprising that poverty numbers have worsened, especially during the worst recession since the great depression,\\\" levine said. hard times didn't hit just in milwaukee. real median household income in the state declined between 2008 and 2009 - decreasing by 3.8% from $51,942 to $49,993. poverty also surged statewide from 10.4% to 12.4% in 2009. there were an estimated 570,583 people in poverty in the state in 2008 and 683,408 people in poverty in 2009. nationally, poverty increased from 38.3 million people in 2008 to 42.8 million in 2009. ken taylor, executive director of the wisconsin council on children and families, labeled the poverty numbers as \\\"brutal\\\" and said they \\\"confirm our worst fears about the reality of the recession on kids.\\\" \\\"the idea that what happens in milwaukee doesn't influence ozaukee county is a fallacy,\\\" he said. \\\"we're all affected across the state by the challenges in milwaukee.\\\" in the suburbs outside milwaukee, the poverty rates were much lower, led by waukesha county (4.8%) while ozaukee (5.3%) and washington (5.4%) counties were not much higher. the poverty rates in those counties all increased at least 1 percentage point. the results come from the american community survey, which provides a snapshot of the nation's socioeconomic, housing and demographic characteristics. later this year, the census bureau will release the first results from the 2010 census, the complete count of every person in the country. erin richards of the journal sentinel staff contributed to this report.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

Limited Control Options exist control method include hunt and trap the animal , but in spite of eliminate a considerable number of the animal , feral swine continue to spread into other state not previously know to be feed or breeding ground . overall , 39 state have report some level of problem with wild pig . Texas be home to more feral pig than any other state \\u2014 an estimate 30 percent to 50 percent of all feral swine in the nation , accord to USDA . More effort to reduce their number have occur in Texas than anywhere else , represent more trap , more hunt , and more research . yet their number be grow , and so be the amount of damage they cause each year . in 2017 Texas Commissioner of Agriculture Sid Miller unveil a wide - reach plan to deal with the feral hog problem , call for what he term a hog - apocalypse involve the distribution of a deadly poison bait . Miller initially approve the legal use of a commercial poison that contain warfarin , the same drug use to kill rat or prescribe by doctor , in small dose , to prevent blood clot . once feral swine ingest the poison , they begin to bleed internally . but hunter and conservationist express concern , fear other animal may be expose to the toxin , possibly affect any animal or human predator feed on the meat of a poison pig . shortly after announce it use , the manufacturer of the poison bait voluntarily remove the product from the market out of fear of lawsuit and other possible retribution .

Wildlife Services take the selection and use of toxic bait for use in wildlife damage management very seriously . the final environmental assessment , FONSI and EUP , be the result of year of collaborative research by Wildlife Services and multiple private , state , federal and international partner , report APHIS Wildlife Services WS Deputy Administrator Bill Clay . with these in place , we can now begin field trial to help determine the effectiveness of the sodium nitrite toxic bait for remove feral swine sounder in natural setting , a well a any potential impact to non - target wildlife . Safeguards Clay say the eup allow researcher to partner with landowner to identify and target three to nine feral swine sounder herd each in Texas and Alabama . he say bait delivery system design to prevent access by non - target wildlife will be fill with placebo bait , place in the sounder \\u2019 territory and monitor with motion - activate camera . follow a period of acclimation to confirm feral swine use of the baiting area , the placebo bait will be replace with sodium nitrite toxic bait for two night . a a research method , at least 30 feral swine and no more than 30 raccoon in each state \\u2019s study area be to be capture live and radio - collar prior to bait in order to monitor their movement and exposure to the bait . landowner within 300 meter of bait station will be notify , and sign will be place on bait station and along road lead into the study area . Sodium nitrite NaNO2 be a meat preservative commonly use to cure meat such a sausage and bacon . when eat in high dose over a short period of time , it be toxic to feral swine . the mode of death be similar to carbon monoxide poisoning . once enough sodium nitrite bait be eat , the feral swine get faint , be render unconscious , and quickly die . in most case , feral swine die within two and - a - half to three hour after eat a lethal dose , Clay say . researcher say many factor be consider when develop a toxic bait for feral swine . not only must it be effective and humane in eliminate feral swine , but also must be low risk for those handle it , the environment , and wildlife . other wildlife , such a raccoon , bear and deer , may be attract to the sodium nitrite toxic bait , but to prevent non - target specie from access it , researcher will use delivery system and bait strategy design to target feral swine . trial will not be conduct in area with know black bear population . the trial be schedule to begin in both Alabama and Texas a early a February . although trapping , aerial operation , and recreational hunting of feral swine have effectively reduce damage in some area , study show that at least 70 percent of feral swine must be remove each year in order to prevent population growth , Clay say . should the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approve the toxic bait for use with feral swine , it could become another tool in the toolbox for integrate feral swine damage management . skeptic while farmer welcome technology that help to control the damage swine in their field , there be skeptic .

Marshall hasn\\u2019t released a formal statement, but when reached for comment by Missourinet, was critical of the inquiry and said the Las Vegas shooter\\u2019s use of automatic weapons was not a state issue.  \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe that we would, within hours of a mass shooting, be talking politics on this.

An AR-15 is a semi-automatic weapon.  During an interview with Missourinet Columbia affiliate KSSZ, Petersen said ban was politically motivated. \\u201cFacebook\\u2019s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg has donated the maximum amount allowable to my opponent Claire McCaskill, so something\\u2019s fishy.\\u201d  At least 58 people have died from Sunday night\\u2019s mass shooting in Las Vegas, which also injured more than 500 people\",\n          \"It\\u2019s no secret that Epstein and Schiff share a long history of perversion. Last year, it was revealed by the FBI that the two corresponded by email on several occasions, totaling 256 emails. But, according to the latest leak, it goes much deeper than just emails.  The reasons for the visits were not recorded, but based on the emails between the two men, we can assume they were for nefarious reasons.  An FBI insider has leaked the extensive visitor logs to Epstein Isle. Several notable names were mentioned in the log, including Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Nancy Pelosi. But the most frequent visitor was none other than Adam Schiff, who visited 78 times over the span of five years.  Chief Inspector of the Department of Investigation, Joe Barron, gave his thoughts about the case, saying the details were sickening.  \\u201cWhat we have discovered over the past few months has been disturbing, to say the least. This goes to very very highest levels. No one could have predicted this. Only the foil hats would have thought this to be possible. Schiff looks to be the ringleader of the operation, arranging the trades and handled the financing. I can\\u2019t say anything else since it\\u2019s a nonexistent investigation, but rest assured justice will be served. In America, no one is above the law, except the rich.\\u201d  This is truly sickening news, but not unexpected. It was well-known that Schiff and Epstein were in cahoots, but the fact that Epstein was one of the main figures behind the operation was unexpected. This explains the impeachment hoax, since he was looking for a distraction.  These people are in the highest levels of government and need to be found out and prosecuted.  We can\\u2019t have this type of behavior in America.\",\n          \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is full of violence that, in my opinion, exceeds the physical comedy of the original film and is borderline barbarism. The main antagonists were subjected to bricks thrown at them from atop a building, being shot with a staple gun, having their heads lit afire, and being electrocuted. It is actually hard to watch.  But, for CBC TV in Canada, the following scene was too much, and had to be removed from their broadcast of the film:  That\\u2019s right, ComicBook.com reports that CBC edited out Donald Trump\\u2019s cameo from the 1992 movie. And people watching it were quick to report the suspicious omission on social media. Some were outraged, and the snowflakes were thrilled.  You guys are the biggest bush league \\u201cjournalists\\u201d of all time. Editing out Trump\\u2019s cameo in Home Alone 2. What kind of state-sponsored bullshit it that? #Defund \\u2014 James @Jameseast_ December 23, 2019  https://twitter.com/TEKO8827/status/1209962103295086592  @CBC Cutting Trump from Home Alone 2 is disgusting & your pathetic \\u2014 Wrestling Fan Forever @617WrestlingFan December 25, 2019  https://twitter.com/ADiMarco25/status/1206364668576579586  According to the CBC, the movie \\u201cwas edited to allow for commercial time within the format.\\u201d  Here\\u2019s where that explanation fails to pass the smell test:  Donald Trump formally announced his campaign in June 2015. The first time the CBC\\u2019s cutting of Trump\\u2019s cameo appearance was acknowledged on Twitter was around Christmas that year:  Thanks @CBC for cutting @realDonaldTrump out of Home Alone 2. \\u2014 Colt McCaullany???? @DENNISGRIMBLE December 22, 2015  Now, either 2015 happened to be the first year the CBC broadcasted the movie, which I highly doubt, or something happened between the 2014 CBC broadcast of Home Alone 2, and the 2015 CBC broadcast. One could argue that Trump wasn\\u2019t a political figure in the public\\u2019s conscious before 2015, but years prior he had been making headlines for publicly questioning Obama\\u2019s birth certificate\\u2014so I don\\u2019t think that excuse really works. Had his cameo been cut before then, I\\u2019m sure it would have been noticed.  Trump\\u2019s presidential bid appears to be the beginning of the folks at the CBC being triggered by Trump so badly that they actually had to edit him out of their broadcast of the film. I can\\u2019t decide if this is hilarious or sad.  Update January 2: Just to be clear, the CBC issued a formal statement saying Home Alone 2 was edited in 2014 when they first obtained the rights to the movie.  _____  Matt Margolis is the author of Trumping Obama: How President Trump Saved Us From Barack Obama\\u2019s Legacy and the bestselling book The Worst President in History: The Legacy of Barack Obama.

I get a call from someone who want to talk about politic in a mass shooting , \\\" say Marshall . \\\" when it come to automatic weapon , that \\u2019 a federal issue a you know . \\\" Marshall go on to stress the involvement of human shortcoming in the incident . \\\" it \\u2019 nothing other than a human tragedy for our country . I think what it show , it show we \\u2019ve get some serious cultural issue , some serious heart issue in the nation . \\\" after Governor Greitens have metal detector instal in the state capitol this year and restrict people from enter with gun , Marshall offer his own an alternative . on his Facebook page and his office door , Marshall post the message \\\" effective immediately , any constituent of mine with a CCW that be not allow to bring his firearm into the Capitol may stop by my office and borrow one for the duration of the visit . \\\" one of the Missouri legislature \\u2019s most fierce proponent of gun restriction be Democratic Representative Stacy Newman of Richmond Heights . she tell Missourinet that Marshall be not exactly correct about federal oversight of automatic weapon , cite 2011 legislation pas by state lawmaker know a House Bill 294 . \\\" part of this omnibus gun bill that year legalize machine gun in the state of Missouri . we legalize they here . and ever since then , continually my whole time in the legislature , we have loosen restriction . \\\" Newman also say voter have fail to hold lawmaker responsible for current law which allow access to rapid fire weapon . \\\" we elect people and then expect they to change their spot when they be in office . they \\u2019re not go to do it because they \\u2019re answer to the gun lobby . the gun lobby only care about more sale . that \\u2019 it \\\" . Austin Petersen , a republican candidate for the U.S. Senate seat hold by McCaskill , express sadness over the shooting and ask for unity in overcome it . \\\" I \\u2019m heartbroken over the tragic event in Las Vegas yesterday , \\\" Petersen say . \\\" this horrendous act of violence touch and hurt we all a a nation and we must come together to heal and find answer . I send my most sincere condolence to all of the victim and their family . please help and love one another . \\\" Petersen have criticize Facebook for ban he from the site for 30 day after he post a live stream video of himself talk about an ar-15 rifle he \\u2019s give away . an ar-15 be a semi - automatic weapon . during an interview with Missourinet Columbia affiliate KSSZ , Petersen say ban be politically motivated . \\\" Facebook \\u2019s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg have donate the maximum amount allowable to my opponent Claire McCaskill , so something \\u2019 fishy . \\\" at least 58 people have die from Sunday night \\u2019s mass shooting in Las Vegas , which also injure more than 500 people\",\n          \"Leaked Visitor Logs Reveal Schiff \\u2019s 78 visit to Epstein Isle it \\u2019 no secret that Epstein and Schiff share a long history of perversion . last year , it be reveal by the FBI that the two correspond by email on several occasion , total 256 email . but , accord to the late leak , it go much deep than just email . the reason for the visit be not record , but base on the email between the two man , we can assume they be for nefarious reason . an FBI insider have leak the extensive visitor log to Epstein Isle . several notable name be mention in the log , include Bill Clinton , Bill Gates , Jeff Bezos , and Nancy Pelosi . but the most frequent visitor be none other than Adam Schiff , who visit 78 time over the span of five year . Chief Inspector of the Department of Investigation , Joe Barron , give his thought about the case , say the detail be sicken . \\\" what we have discover over the past few month have be disturb , to say the least . this go to very very high level . no one could have predict this . only the foil hat would have think this to be possible . schiff look to be the ringleader of the operation , arrange the trade and handle the financing . I can not say anything else since it \\u2019 a nonexistent investigation , but rest assure justice will be serve . in America , no one be above the law , except the rich . \\\" this be truly sicken news , but not unexpected . it be well - know that Schiff and Epstein be in cahoot , but the fact that Epstein be one of the main figure behind the operation be unexpected . this explain the impeachment hoax , since he be look for a distraction . these people be in the high level of government and need to be find out and prosecute . we can not have this type of behavior in America .\"\n

Released last week and titled \\u201cIdentifying Post-vaccination Complications & Their Causes: an Analysis of Covid-19 Patient Data,\\u201d the stated purpose of the document is \\u201cto provide additional information for concerned citizens, health experts, and policymakers about adverse events and other post-vaccination issues resulting from the three experimental COVID-19 vaccines currently administered under EUA (emergency use authorization)\\u201d by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The non-profit organization highlighted the thousands of adverse events which are related to these \\u201cvaccines\\u201d and captured by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\u2019s (CDC) Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). \\u201cYet these complications have received a fraction of the attention paid to J&J\\u2019s blood-clotting controversy,\\u201d they lamented with dismay, asking, \\u201cWhy?\\u201d  In taking a closer look at this data, AFLDS presents \\u201csome major categories of concern as-yet publicly unaddressed by either the FDA or CDC,\\u201d asserting that failure of these regulators \\u201cto consider these and other \\u2018known unknowns\\u2019 is a dereliction of basic medical research.\\u201d  They breakout their general categories of concern as shown below:  First, there are significant fears regarding the wide distribution of these new vaccines, which employ a new technology and remain only experimental without full approval from the FDA. Instead of employing an attenuated antigen response \\u2013 as happens with conventional vaccines \\u2013 these experimental agents introduce something called a \\u201cspike protein\\u201d into one\\u2019s system.  \\u201cIt takes years to be sure something new is safe,\\u201d the AFLDS document confirms. \\u201cNo one knows definitively the long-term health implications for the body and brain, especially among the young, related to this spike protein. In addition, if documented problems with the protein do arise, there will never be any way to reverse the adverse effects in those already vaccinated.\\u201d  Second, unlike conventional vaccines, these spike proteins, along with \\u201clipid nanoparticles\\u201d have the capacity to pass through the \\u201cblood-brain barrier\\u201d which provides special protection for these sensitive areas of the body.  \\u201cThere simply has not been enough time to know what brain problems and how often a brain problem will develop from that,\\u201d the document warns.  Risks from such penetration include \\u201cchronic inflammation and thrombosis (clotting) in the neurological system, contributing to tremors, chronic lethargy, stroke, Bell\\u2019s Palsy and ALS-type symptoms. The lipid nanoparticles can potentially fuse with brain cells, resulting in delayed neuro-degenerative disease. And the mRNA-induced spike protein can bind to brain tissue 10 to 20 times stronger than the spike proteins that are (naturally) part of the original virus.\\u201d  Third, as these experimental vaccines produce many trillions of spike proteins in their recipients, these vaccinated individuals \\u201ccan shed some of these (spike protein) particles to close contacts,\\u201d causing disease in them.  In an email correspondence with LifeSiteNews, Dr. Simone Gold, the founder of AFLDS, directed this writer to an April 29 tweet where she posted a document from Pfizer\\u2019s experimental trials in which the pharmaceutical giant \\u201cacknowledges this mechanism\\u201d of potential shedding, she wrote.  As the document states, one can be \\u201cexposed to [the] study intervention due to environmental exposure,\\u201d including \\u201cby inhalation or skin contact\\u201d with someone involved in the study, or with another who has been exposed in the same way.  And this, according to AFLDS, can be dangerous. As the issues brief continues, \\u201cthe spike proteins are pathogenic (\\u2018disease causing\\u2019) just like the full virus.\\u201d Furthermore, these \\u201cspike proteins bind more tightly than the fully intact virus\\u201d and thus cases around the world of \\u201cpericarditis, shingles, pneumonia, blood clots in the extremities and brain, Bell\\u2019s Palsy, vaginal bleeding and miscarriages have been reported in persons who are near persons who have been vaccinated.\\u201d Such shedding also \\u201cappears to be causing wide variety of autoimmune disease (where the body attacks its own tissue) in some persons.\\u201d  In addition, other more serious dangers to even the unvaccinated are possible due to the fact that these \\u201cspike proteins can cross the blood brain barrier, unlike traditional vaccines.\\u201d  Fourth, such shedding leaves children vulnerable if they are in proximity to parents and teachers who have received these experimental vaccines. While the threat of COVID-19 to the young is rightly described as \\u201cirrelevant,\\u201d including a 99.997% survival rate for those under 20 years of age, AFLDS is concerned some children may become symptomatic due to such proximity to the vaccinated. At such point there is a danger that \\u201cpublic health bureaucrats\\u201d might use such cases to \\u201cspeculate that a child\\u2019s illness is related to a SARS-CoV-2 \\u2018variant,\\u2019\\u201d when it is a result of contact with vaccinated adults.  \\u201cOur other concern is that children could develop long-term chronic autoimmune disease including neurological problems due to the fact that children have decades ahead of them and trillions of the spike proteins mentioned above.\\u201d  Fifth, \\u201cAFLDS is aware of thousands of reports involving vaginal bleeding, post-menopausal vaginal bleeding, and miscarriages following COVID-19 vaccination as well as anecdotal reports of similar adverse events among those in close contact with the vaccinated.\\u201d While at this point the independent physicians organization \\u201ccannot comment definitively on the close contacts\\u201d other than to mention they \\u201chave heard reports of this worldwide,\\u201d the many reported incidents of post-vaccination vaginal bleeding establishes a clear \\u201cconnection between the vaccine and irregular bleeding.\\u201d  \\u201cDespite this clear-cut evidence, menstrual-cycle changes were not listed among the FDA\\u2019s common side effects in its phase-three clinical participants. Women\\u2019s reproductive health needs to be taken seriously rather than waved away by agenda-driven public health officials,\\u201d the brief reads.  Finally, acknowledging the \\u201cirrepressible economic incentive among pharmaceutical companies\\u201d to market unnecessary and dangerous childhood COVID vaccines, boosters, and the like, AFLDS insists \\u201cPublic health experts should stop and assess data on possible vaccine side effects and related post-vaccination questions before it is too late.\\u201d\",\n          \"The Georgia twin senate runoff is going the way we expected.

The wrangling over masks, considered by pediatricians and epidemiologists to be one of the most effective ways to stop school spread, has turned deeply personal and political, fueling vitriol at school board meetings that have left board members fearing for their safety. Several Republican-led states have barred school districts from requiring masks, threatening to fine school leaders or cut state funding if they attempt it. Caught in the fray are school leaders, who are forced to again navigate constantly shifting pandemic conditions, conflicting guidance on how to manage them and political fights \\u2014 all while trying to craft policies that will keep students safe and buildings open. Because despite the deep divide over masks, there is a virtual consensus that it is critical to get children back to face-to-face learning. Advertisement \\u201cPolitics play into it,\\u201d Dan Nerelli, superintendent of the Chichester School District outside Philadelphia, said of the national climate. In his district, masks were optional during the summer and no decision has been made yet on the fall. \\u201cPeople don\\u2019t want to say it, but it\\u2019s a hot topic, and as superintendents we get caught in the middle of it.\\u201d Biden presses federal workers to get vaccinated, with new testing, masking and distancing rules for those who refuse Nearly everyone agrees that children should be back in classrooms, a goal that is now being threatened by the delta variant and the mask debate. Parents in both camps \\u2014 those who support mask mandates and those who oppose them \\u2014 are pulling their children from brick-and-mortar schools in districts where they disagree with masking policies. A rash of cases among students and staffers in the Ash Fork School District in Arizona, which opened its doors last week for the new school year, forced the school system to close buildings Wednesday. In a video, Superintendent Seth Staples pleaded with parents for patience. He noted, too, that while masks were recommended, the state barred him from requiring them. Advertisement A spike in coronavirus cases \\u2014 and a critical shortage of hospital beds \\u2014 pushed Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) to declare a state of emergency and to call the legislature back in to session to reconsider the state\\u2019s ban on mask mandates. On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance urging everyone in school buildings to wear masks, regardless of vaccination status, a response to growing concerns over the highly contagious delta variant. That was a shift from guidance issued just three weeks prior, when the agency said only unvaccinated people in school buildings needed masks. CDC changes course on school guidance, advising everyone to wear masks Several school districts, including in New Orleans and Georgia\\u2019s Gwinnett County, took heed and will require universal masking in schools for the coming school year. GOP leaders balked. \\u201cThis is just another example of the Biden-Harris administration\\u2019s inability to effectively confront the COVID-19 pandemic,\\u201d Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) said in a statement. Ducey, who banned schools from implementing mask mandates and then helped make it state law, said that requiring masks even for the vaccinated would lead people to wrongly believe that vaccine is not effective. Advertisement The fights over mask mandates and other pandemic adjustments have taken a scary turn in some school districts. Paul Imhoff, who is president of a nationwide association for school superintendents and heads the Upper Arlington school district in Ohio, said some of his colleagues have told him that they have stationed armed security guards outside their homes, worried that rancor will turn into violence. Ducey is one of several GOP governors who have backed efforts to ban or discourage school leaders from implementing mask mandates, saying they want to leave decisions about masking up to parents. Their actions have drawn criticism from those who say they are ignoring public health guidance in order to play to their base of supporters. CDC urges vaccinated people in covid hot spots to resume wearing masks indoors Some opponents of mask mandates rely on fringe science to back their claims that masks are ineffective. Others say that they are concerned masks will leave children traumatized and impede their learning and that the disease poses little threat to children \\u2014 though they can still spread it to adults. Advertisement And many argue that the public health guidelines infringe on their personal liberty. John Kuhn, superintendent of the small, rural Mineral Wells Independent School District in Texas, said he understands why some parents oppose mask mandates. There are those who oppose any pandemic restrictions and worry they will again lead to a full-scale shutdown, even though public health officials have said the opposite \\u2014 that mask-wearing could prevent shutdowns. \\u201cWill covid-19 spread more readily if government doesn\\u2019t require masks? Yes. Is it dangerous? Yes. I don\\u2019t think school people are ignorant of these realities or deny them,\\u201d Kuhn said. \\u201cThere are no easy answers here. Basically, a school\\u2019s masking policy has to reflect its community\\u2019s masking expectations.\\u201d In states where mask mandates have been banned, it means local school leaders have to choose between breaking the law or ignoring CDC guidelines. Texas has threatened school leaders with fines if they attempt to implement mask requirements, and in Arizona and South Carolina, schools can lose state funding if they defy the bans. Advertisement In Austin, where Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) issued an executive order banning mask mandates, school leaders are preparing to accommodate children whose parents will not send them to school alongside unmasked students and staffers. The Austin Independent School District recently expanded its virtual offerings, even though the state is not paying for it. \\u201cWe know that masks work, and kids were great at wearing masks,\\u201d said Jason Stanford, spokesman for the school district. \\u201cWe would absolutely be mandating masks if we were allowed to.\\u201d In Florida, where cases of the delta variant are rising sharply, a showdown appears to be looming between Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), a staunch opponent of mask mandates, and at least one school district that this week reversed its fall mask-optional policy, opting to require masks for all. Advertisement \\u201cThere is no way in good conscience that I could bring anybody back into the school environment, on the bus, the cafeteria, and not have a mask mandate,\\u201d said Rosalind Osgood, chair of the Broward County School Board. Opponents of the mask mandate had gathered at the school board meeting Tuesday, burning masks. The board was forced to adjourn early because they refused to wear masks inside the building, CBS4 in Miami reported. On Wednesday, opponents arrived armed with what they said was evidence that masks do not work. One mother lifted her young daughter to the microphone to address the members. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to wear it, because I can\\u2019t breath,\\u201d she said. In Iowa City, parents asked the school district to educate masked and unmasked students separately, since the state barred it from passing a mask mandate. \\u201cThe parents, rightly so, are trying to find clever ways to work around the laws and still keep their kids safe,\\u201d said Shawn Eyestone, president of the school board. \\u201cBut the problem is, logistically, it\\u2019s almost impossible.\\u201d Advertisement The debate has also illuminated a stark racial divide in the pandemic. Anti-mask protesters in many places are mostly White. In large urban districts and majority-Black districts, the mask mandates have been largely uncontroversial. It\\u2019s a contrast that has been reflected in polls. In May, more than three-quarters of Black, Hispanic and Asian parents said they needed mask requirements to feel safe sending their children back in to classrooms, compared with 53 percent of White parents, according to research done by the Rand Corp. New York, Chicago and Los Angeles never lifted their universal masking requirements. And when Clayton County, Ga., outside Atlanta, decided to expand its mask mandate, school leaders heard little fuss. \\u201cMany of our families are front-line workers. [Our community] was hit very hard,\\u201d Superintendent Morcease Beasley said. \\u201cThat has contributed to us here in Clayton County hearing little pushback, because those families have experienced the impact of this pandemic firsthand.\\u201d\",\n          \"7th Lecture Series: Makinde hails Oduyoye, describes him as a unifier Engr. \\u2018Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, on Tuesday, described Hon. Babatunde Oduyoye, who is currently serving as his Special Adviser on Strategy and Political Matters, as a unifier.  The governor gave the commendation while speaking at the Annual Birthday Lecture Series in commemoration of the birthday of the former Minority Whip of the House of Representatives and a two-term member of the House, Hon. (Chief) Babatunde Oduyoye, at Oritsejolomi Hall, International Conference Centre, University of Ibadan.  The lecture, with the topic: \\u2018Security and National Unity in Difficult Times\\u2019 was delivered by the chairman of the Nigerian Governors\\u2019 Forum (NGF) and governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi.  He equally commended the celebrant for always demonstrating a commitment to any course he believes in to the point of success, adding that, as a governor, he has won many political battles with the intervention of Oduyoye.  \\u201cWell, we have all listened to the lecture, which was given by a Ph.D. holder in war studies. But I only have one or two things to say about today\\u2019s celebrant, Hon Babatunde Oduyoye. Governor Fayemi said he is a good man. Yes, He is.  \\u201cAnd one thing I can say about Hon Babatunde Oduyoye is, He is a unifier. In this gathering, I have seen members of the APC and PDP. I can also see members of the aggrieved PDP. Also, I can see some members of progressives (Afenifere). So, He is a unifier.  \\u201cIn 2015, I contested to be the governor and lost. I was going around to see where I was not doing things right and then a very close brother of mine told me that I did not look for a unifier and that was why I lost the election. So, he took me to Hon. Oduyoye. And when I got to him, he said I failed because all other governorship candidates came to meet him and I did not come. And I said, going forward, we will work together. And from that point forward, he demonstrated commitment.  \\u201cAnd I can tell you that he flew outside the country on my behalf to go have a former governor to accept me into the fold and, at the end, of the day, God took control.  \\u201cIf Hon. Oduyoye makes any commitment, you can rest assured that he will follow through. So, I did not have any problem after I was sworn in as the governor and I had to appoint him as my Special Adviser and Politics and Strategy. He has been doing some talking behind the scene.  \\u201cToday, I am happy to be here for this lecture series. I pray that many more will come. And I am using you as a point of contact for Nigeria and all the October 1st celebrants. I wish all of you many more years of fruitful service to our state, our country in good health.\\u201d  The Babatunde Oduyoye Annual Birthday Lecture Series is a platform for discussion of critical national issues and proffering solutions to contemporary national existential challenges.

coronavirus cases have left school leaders across the country embroiled in debates over whether to require masks in schools, muddling a long-sought return to normalcy for millions of children. the wrangling over masks, considered by pediatricians and epidemiologists to be one of the most effective ways to stop school spread, has turned deeply personal and political, fueling vitriol at school board meetings that have left board members fearing for their safety. several republican-led states have barred school districts from requiring masks, threatening to fine school leaders or cut state funding if they attempt it. caught in the fray are school leaders, who are forced to again navigate constantly shifting pandemic conditions, conflicting guidance on how to manage them and political fights \\u2014 all while trying to craft policies that will keep students safe and buildings open. because despite the deep divide over masks, there is a virtual consensus that it is critical to get children back to face-to-face learning. advertisement \\u201cpolitics play into it,\\u201d dan nerelli, superintendent of the chichester school district outside philadelphia, said of the national climate. in his district, masks were optional during the summer and no decision has been made yet on the fall. \\u201cpeople don\\u2019t want to say it, but it\\u2019s a hot topic, and as superintendents we get caught in the middle of it.\\u201d biden presses federal workers to get vaccinated, with new testing, masking and distancing rules for those who refuse nearly everyone agrees that children should be back in classrooms, a goal that is now being threatened by the delta variant and the mask debate. parents in both camps \\u2014 those who support mask mandates and those who oppose them \\u2014 are pulling their children from brick-and-mortar schools in districts where they disagree with masking policies. a rash of cases among students and staffers in the ash fork school district in arizona, which opened its doors last week for the new school year, forced the school system to close buildings wednesday. in a video, superintendent seth staples pleaded with parents for patience. he noted, too, that while masks were recommended, the state barred him from requiring them. advertisement a spike in coronavirus cases \\u2014 and a critical shortage of hospital beds \\u2014 pushed arkansas gov. asa hutchinson (r) to declare a state of emergency and to call the legislature back in to session to reconsider the state\\u2019s ban on mask mandates. on tuesday, the centers for disease control and prevention issued guidance urging everyone in school buildings to wear masks, regardless of vaccination status, a response to growing concerns over the highly contagious delta variant. that was a shift from guidance issued just three weeks prior, when the agency said only unvaccinated people in school buildings needed masks. cdc changes course on school guidance, advising everyone to wear masks several school districts, including in new orleans and georgia\\u2019s gwinnett county, took heed and will require universal masking in schools for the coming school year. gop leaders balked. \\u201cthis is just another example of the biden-harris administration\\u2019s inability to effectively confront the covid-19 pandemic,\\u201d arizona gov. doug ducey (r) said in a statement. ducey, who banned schools from implementing mask mandates and then helped make it state law, said that requiring masks even for the vaccinated would lead people to wrongly believe that vaccine is not effective. advertisement the fights over mask mandates and other pandemic adjustments have taken a scary turn in some school districts. paul imhoff, who is president of a nationwide association for school superintendents and heads the upper arlington school district in ohio, said some of his colleagues have told him that they have stationed armed security guards outside their homes, worried that rancor will turn into violence. ducey is one of several gop governors who have backed efforts to ban or discourage school leaders from implementing mask mandates, saying they want to leave decisions about masking up to parents. their actions have drawn criticism from those who say they are ignoring public health guidance in order to play to their base of supporters. cdc urges vaccinated people in covid hot spots to resume wearing masks indoors some opponents of mask mandates rely on fringe science to back their claims that masks are ineffective. others say that they are concerned masks will leave children traumatized and impede their learning and that the disease poses little threat to children \\u2014 though they can still spread it to adults. advertisement and many argue that the public health guidelines infringe on their personal liberty. john kuhn, superintendent of the small, rural mineral wells independent school district in texas, said he understands why some parents oppose mask mandates. there are those who oppose any pandemic restrictions and worry they will again lead to a full-scale shutdown, even though public health officials have said the opposite \\u2014 that mask-wearing could prevent shutdowns. \\u201cwill covid-19 spread more readily if government doesn\\u2019t require masks? yes. is it dangerous? yes. i don\\u2019t think school people are ignorant of these realities or deny them,\\u201d kuhn said. \\u201cthere are no easy answers here. basically, a school\\u2019s masking policy has to reflect its community\\u2019s masking expectations.\\u201d in states where mask mandates have been banned, it means local school leaders have to choose between breaking the law or ignoring cdc guidelines. texas has threatened school leaders with fines if they attempt to implement mask requirements, and in arizona and south carolina, schools can lose state funding if they defy the bans. advertisement in austin, where texas gov. greg abbott (r) issued an executive order banning mask mandates, school leaders are preparing to accommodate children whose parents will not send them to school alongside unmasked students and staffers. the austin independent school district recently expanded its virtual offerings, even though the state is not paying for it. \\u201cwe know that masks work, and kids were great at wearing masks,\\u201d said jason stanford, spokesman for the school district. \\u201cwe would absolutely be mandating masks if we were allowed to.\\u201d in florida, where cases of the delta variant are rising sharply, a showdown appears to be looming between gov. ron desantis (r), a staunch opponent of mask mandates, and at least one school district that this week reversed its fall mask-optional policy, opting to require masks for all. advertisement \\u201cthere is no way in good conscience that i could bring anybody back into the school environment, on the bus, the cafeteria, and not have a mask mandate,\\u201d said rosalind osgood, chair of the broward county school board. opponents of the mask mandate had gathered at the school board meeting tuesday, burning masks. the board was forced to adjourn early because they refused to wear masks inside the building, cbs4 in miami reported. on wednesday, opponents arrived armed with what they said was evidence that masks do not work. one mother lifted her young daughter to the microphone to address the members. \\u201ci don\\u2019t want to wear it, because i can\\u2019t breath,\\u201d she said. in iowa city, parents asked the school district to educate masked and unmasked students separately, since the state barred it from passing a mask mandate. \\u201cthe parents, rightly so, are trying to find clever ways to work around the laws and still keep their kids safe,\\u201d said shawn eyestone, president of the school board. \\u201cbut the problem is, logistically, it\\u2019s almost impossible.\\u201d advertisement the debate has also illuminated a stark racial divide in the pandemic. anti-mask protesters in many places are mostly white. in large urban districts and majority-black districts, the mask mandates have been largely uncontroversial. it\\u2019s a contrast that has been reflected in polls. in may, more than three-quarters of black, hispanic and asian parents said they needed mask requirements to feel safe sending their children back in to classrooms, compared with 53 percent of white parents, according to research done by the rand corp. new york, chicago and los angeles never lifted their universal masking requirements. and when clayton county, ga., outside atlanta, decided to expand its mask mandate, school leaders heard little fuss. \\u201cmany of our families are front-line workers. [our community] was hit very hard,\\u201d superintendent morcease beasley said. \\u201cthat has contributed to us here in clayton county hearing little pushback, because those families have experienced the impact of this pandemic firsthand.\\u201d\",\n          \"biden denied entry to pentagon the man who calls himself president of the united states, joseph r. biden, was denied entry to the pentagon on friday, real raw news has learned.  shortly after meeting democratic lawmakers to discuss more restrictive gun-control legislation, biden went to arlington, va to advocate the merits of his planned withdrawal of all u.s. armed forces from afghanistan. he had also sought to convince military leaders that iran\\u2019s decision to enrich weapons-grade plutonium to 60% did not threaten u.s. interests, said an administration source speaking under condition of anonymity.  but biden never made it inside.  our source said u.s. pentagon police, part of the pentagon force protection agency, stopped biden and his secret service detail in their tracks, informing them that they had standing orders to prevent biden administration members\\u2013including biden\\u2013from entering the building. those orders reportedly included the use of deadly force.  \\u201cbiden demanded to know who gave the order, stumbling through his words, and was told the directive came directly from gen. david h. berger, commandant of the united states marine corps and a ranking member of the joint chiefs of staff. when biden demanded to speak with chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen. mark milley, he was told milley\\u2014a biden supporter\\u2014was no longer in charge,\\u201d our source said.  biden, our source added, became belligerent, saying as the president of the united states he had unrestricted access to all federal properties, including the pentagon. he then instructed his three-man ss detail to \\u201cresolve the issue.\\u201d  pentagon police drew sidearms, our source said.  \\u201cthe pentagon protection force told the ss agents they\\u2019d be making a mistake. that there were over a hundred inside ready to back them up if trouble started. the ss didn\\u2019t want any part of that and told biden he\\u2019d have to force his way in himself, if he was so inclined,\\u201d our source said.  moreover, biden purportedly muttered an unbelievable phrase: \\u201ci bet that bastard is inside.\\u201d  we can only guess as to whom he was referring, but rrn guesses he meant none other donald j. trump. while it seems unlikely, we must remember that chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mark milley opposed trump\\u2019s presidency and was one of few high-ranking military leaders who supported biden\\u2019s alleged 2020 victory. it is possible that gen. milley has been overthrown, and marine corps gen. david berger has assumed command of the joint chiefs of staff.  rrn will provide updates as they become available.

Oduyoye . and when I get to he , he say I fail because all other governorship candidate come to meet he and I do not come . and I say , go forward , we will work together . and from that point forward , he demonstrate commitment . \\\" and I can tell you that he fly outside the country on my behalf to go have a former governor to accept I into the fold and , at the end , of the day , God take control . \\\" if Hon . Oduyoye make any commitment , you can rest assure that he will follow through . so , I do not have any problem after I be swear in a the governor and I have to appoint he a my Special Adviser and Politics and Strategy . he have be do some talk behind the scene . \\\" today , I be happy to be here for this lecture series . I pray that many more will come . and I be use you a a point of contact for Nigeria and all the October 1st celebrant . I wish all of you many more year of fruitful service to our state , our country in good health . \\\" the Babatunde Oduyoye Annual Birthday Lecture Series be a platform for discussion of critical national issue and proffer solution to contemporary national existential challenge . some of the previous lecture be deliver by notable personality include the former Speaker of the House of Representatives , Hon .
